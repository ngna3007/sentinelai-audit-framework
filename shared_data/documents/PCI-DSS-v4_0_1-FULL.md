### **1 Introduction and PCI Data Security Standard Overview**

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was developed to encourage and enhance payment account data security and
facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures globally. PCI DSS provides a baseline of technical and operational
requirements designed to protect account data. While specifically designed to focus on environments with payment account data, PCI DSS
can also be used to protect against threats and secure other elements in the payment ecosystem.


Table 1 shows the 12 principal PCI DSS requirements.

This document, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Requirements and Testing Procedures, consists of the 12 PCI DSS
principal requirements, detailed security requirements, corresponding testing procedures, and other information pertinent to each requirement.
The following sections provide detailed guidelines and best practices to assist entities to prepare for, conduct, and report the results of a PCI
DSS assessment. The PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures begin on page 43.

PCI DSS comprises a minimum set of requirements for protecting account data and may be enhanced by additional controls and practices to
further mitigate risks, and to incorporate local, regional, and sector laws and regulations. Additionally, legislation or regulatory requirements
may require specific protection of personal information or other data elements (for example, cardholder name).


_**Limitations**_


If any of the requirements contained in this standard conflict with country, state, or local laws, the country, state, or local law will apply.

### **2 PCI DSS Applicability Information**

PCI DSS is intended for all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD) or could
impact the security of the cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. This includes all entities involved in payment account
processing —including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and other service providers.


Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizations that manage
compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers); contact these organizations for any additional criteria.

#### **Defining Account Data, Cardholder Data, and Sensitive Authentication Data**


Cardholder data and sensitive authentication data are considered account data and are defined as follows:


**Table 2. Account Data**






|Account Data|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Cardholder Data includes:**|**Sensitive Authentication Data includes:**|
|• <br>Primary Account Number (PAN)<br>• <br>Cardholder Name<br>• <br>Expiration Date<br>• <br>Service Code|• <br>Full track data (magnetic-stripe data or equivalent on a chip)<br>• <br>Card verification code<br>• <br>PINs/PIN blocks|


PCI DSS requirements apply to entities with environments where account data (cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data) is stored,
processed, or transmitted, and entities with environments that can impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.


Some PCI DSS requirements may also apply to entities with environments that do not store, process, or transmit account data for example,
entities that outsource payment operations or management of their cardholder data environment (CDE) [1] . Entities that outsource their payment
environments or payment operations to third parties remain responsible for ensuring that the account data is protected by the third party per
applicable PCI DSS requirements.


1 In accordance with those organizations that manage compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers); entities should contact these organizations
for more details.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1_ _June 2024_
_©2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved._ _Page 4_


The primary account number (PAN) is the defining factor for cardholder data. The term account data therefore covers the following: the full
PAN, any other elements of cardholder data that are present with the PAN, and any elements of sensitive authentication data.


If cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed, or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in the
CDE, they must be protected in accordance with the PCI DSS requirements applicable to cardholder data.


If an entity stores, processes, or transmits PAN, then a CDE exists to which PCI DSS requirements will apply. Some requirements may not be
applicable, for example if the entity does not store PAN, then the requirements relating to the protection of stored PAN in Requirement 3 will
not be applicable to the entity.


Even if an entity does not store, process, or transmit PAN, some PCI DSS requirements may still apply. Consider the following:


   - If the entity stores SAD, requirements specifically related to SAD storage in Requirement 3 will be applicable.


   - If the entity engages third-party service providers to store, process or transmit PAN on its behalf, requirements related to the
management of service providers in Requirement 12 will be applicable.


   - If the entity can impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data because the security of an entity’s
infrastructure can affect how cardholder data is processed (for example, via a web server that controls the generation of a payment form
or page) some requirements will be applicable.


   - If cardholder data is only present on physical media (for example paper), requirements relating to the security and disposal of physical
media in Requirement 9 will be applicable.


   - Requirements related to an incident response plan are applicable to all entities, to ensure that there are procedures to follow in the
event of a suspected or actual breach of the confidentiality of cardholder data _._


_**Use of Account Data, Sensitive Authentication Data, Cardholder Data, and Primary Account Number in PCI DSS**_


PCI DSS includes requirements that specifically refer to account data, cardholder data, and sensitive authentication data. It is important to
note that each of these types of data are different and the terms are not interchangeable. Specific references within requirements to account
data, cardholder data, or sensitive authentication data are purposeful, and the requirements apply specifically to the type of data that is
referenced.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1_ _June 2024_

_**Elements of Account Data and Storage Requirements**_


Table 3 identifies the elements of cardholder and sensitive authentication data, whether storage of each data element is permitted or
prohibited, and whether each data element must be rendered unreadable—for example, with strong cryptography—when stored. This table
is not exhaustive and is presented to illustrate only how the stated requirements apply to the different data elements.


**Table 3. Account Data Element Storage Requirements**












|Col1|Col2|Data Elements|Storage Restrictions|Required to Render Stored Data<br>Unreadable|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Account Data**<br>|**Cardholder**<br>**Data**|Primary Account Number (PAN)|Storage is kept to a minimum as defined in<br>Requirement 3.2|Yes, as defined in Requirement 3.5|
|**Account Data**<br>|**Cardholder**<br>**Data**|Cardholder Name|Storage is kept to a minimum as defined in<br>Requirement 3.2 2|No|
|**Account Data**<br>|**Cardholder**<br>**Data**|Service Code|Service Code|Service Code|
|**Account Data**<br>|**Cardholder**<br>**Data**|Expiration Date|Expiration Date|Expiration Date|
|**Account Data**<br>|**Sensitive**<br>**Authentication**<br>**Data**|Full Track Data|Cannot be stored after authorization as<br>defined in Requirement 3.3.1 3|Yes, data stored until authorization is<br>complete must be protected with strong<br>cryptography as defined in Requirement<br>3.3.2|
|**Account Data**<br>|**Sensitive**<br>**Authentication**<br>**Data**|Card verification code|Card verification code|Card verification code|
|**Account Data**<br>|**Sensitive**<br>**Authentication**<br>**Data**|PIN/PIN Block|PIN/PIN Block|PIN/PIN Block|


If PAN is stored with other elements of cardholder data, only the PAN must be rendered unreadable according to PCI DSS Requirement
3.5.1.


Sensitive authentication data must not be stored after authorization, even if encrypted. This applies even for environments where there is no
PAN present.


2 Where data exists in the same environment as PAN.
3 Except as permitted for issuers and companies that support issuing services. Requirements for issuers and issuing services are separately defined in
Requirement 3.3.3.

### **3 Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards**

PCI SSC supports the use of secure payment software within cardholder data environments (CDE) via the Software Security Framework
(SSF), which consists of the Secure Software Standard and the Secure Software Lifecycle (Secure SLC) Standard. Software that is PCI SSC
validated and listed provides assurance that the software has been developed using secure practices and has met a defined set of software
security requirements.



The PCI SSC secure software programs include listings of payment software and software
vendors that have been validated as meeting the applicable PCI SSC Software Standards.


 - **Validated Software** : Payment software listed on the PCI SSC website as a
Validated Payment Application (PA-DSS) or Validated Payment Software (the
Secure Software Standard) has been evaluated by a qualified assessor to confirm
the software meets the security requirements within that standard. The security
requirements in these standards are focused on protecting the integrity and
confidentiality of payment transactions and account data.


 - **Qualified Software Vendors** : The Secure SLC Standard defines security
requirements for software vendors to integrate secure software development
practices throughout the entire software lifecycle. Software vendors that have been
validated as meeting the Secure SLC Standard are listed on the PCI SSC website
as a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.





[For more information about the SSF or PA-DSS, refer to the respective Program Guides at www.pcisecuritystandards.org.](http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)


All software that stores, processes, or transmits account data, or that could impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive
authentication data, is in scope for an entity’s PCI DSS assessment. While the use of validated payment software supports the security of an
entity’s CDE, the use of such software does not by itself make an entity PCI DSS compliant. The entity’s PCI DSS assessment should include
verification that the software is properly configured and securely implemented to support applicable PCI DSS requirements. Additionally, if
PCI-listed payment software has been customized, a more in-depth review will be required during the PCI DSS assessment because the
software may no longer be representative of the version that was originally validated.


Because security threats are constantly evolving, software that is no longer supported by the vendor (for example, identified by the vendor as
“end of life”) may not offer the same level of security as supported versions. Entities are strongly encouraged to keep their software current
and updated to the latest software versions available.


Entities that develop their own software are encouraged to refer to PCI SSC’s software security standards and consider the requirements
therein as best practices to use in their development environments. Secure payment software implemented in a PCI DSS compliant
environment will help minimize the potential for security breaches leading to compromises of account data and fraud. See _Bespoke and_
_Custom Software_ .

#### **Applicability of PCI DSS to Payment Software Vendors**

PCI DSS may apply to a payment software vendor if the vendor is also a service provider that stores, processes, or transmits account data, or
has access to their customers’ account data—for example, in the role of a payment service provider or via remote access to a customer
environment. Software vendors to which PCI DSS may be applicable include those offering payment services, as well as cloud service
providers offering payment terminals in the cloud, software as a service (SaaS), e-commerce in the cloud, and other cloud payment services.


#### **Bespoke and Custom Software**

All bespoke and custom software that stores, processes, or transmits account
data, or that could impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive
authentication data, is in scope for an entity’s PCI DSS assessment.


Bespoke and custom software that has been developed and maintained in
accordance with one of PCI SSC’s Software Security Framework standards
(the Secure Software Standard or the Secure SLC standard) will support an
entity in meeting PCI DSS Requirement 6.


See Appendix F for more details.

### **4 Scope of PCI DSS Requirements**

PCI DSS requirements apply to:


   - The cardholder data environment (CDE), which is comprised of:


– System components, people, and processes that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data,
and,


– System components that may not store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD but have unrestricted connectivity to system components
that store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD.


**AND**


   - System components, people, and processes that could impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. [4]


“System components” include network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, cloud components, and software. Examples
of system components include but are not limited to:


   - Systems that store, process, or transmit account data (for example, payment terminals, authorization systems, clearing systems,
payment middleware systems, payment back-office systems, shopping cart and store front systems, payment gateway/switch systems,
fraud monitoring systems).


   - Systems that provide security services (for example, authentication servers, access control servers, security information and event
management (SIEM) systems, physical security systems (for example, badge access or CCTV), multi-factor authentication systems,
anti-malware systems).


   - Systems that facilitate segmentation (for example, internal network security controls).


   - Systems that could impact the security of account data or the CDE (for example, name resolution, or e-commerce (web) redirection
servers).


   - Virtualization components such as virtual machines, virtual switches/routers, virtual appliances, virtual applications/desktops, and
hypervisors.


   - Cloud infrastructure and components, both external and on premises, and including instantiations of containers or images, virtual
private clouds, cloud-based identity and access management, CDEs residing on premises or in the cloud, service meshes with
containerized applications, and container orchestration tools.

   - Network components, including but not limited to network security controls, switches, routers, VoIP network devices, wireless access
points, network appliances, and other security appliances.


   - Server types, including but not limited to web, application, database, authentication, mail, proxy, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and
Domain Name System (DNS).


   - End-user devices, such as computers, laptops, workstations, administrative workstations, tablets, and mobile devices.


   - Printers, and multi-function devices that scan, print, and fax.


   - Storage of account data in any format (for example, paper, data files, audio files, images, and video recordings).


   - Applications, software, and software components, serverless applications, including all purchased, subscribed (for example, Softwareas-a-Service), bespoke and custom software, including internal and external (for example, Internet) applications.


   - Tools, code repositories, and systems that implement software configuration management or for deployment of objects to the CDE or to
systems that can impact the CDE.

Figure 1 shows considerations for scoping system components for PCI DSS.


**Figure 1. Understanding PCI DSS Scoping**

#### **Annual PCI DSS Scope Confirmation**

The first step in preparing for a PCI DSS assessment is for the entity to accurately determine the scope of the review. The assessed entity
must confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2 by identifying all locations and flows of account
data, and identifying all systems that are connected to or, if compromised, could impact the CDE (for example, authentication servers, remote
access servers, logging servers) to ensure they are included in the PCI DSS scope. All types of systems and locations should be considered
during the scoping process, including backup/recovery sites and fail-over systems.


The minimum steps for an entity to confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope are specified in PCI DSS Requirement 12.5.2. The entity is
expected to retain documentation to show how PCI DSS scope was determined. The documentation is retained for assessor review and for
reference during the entity’s next PCI DSS scope confirmation activity. For each PCI DSS assessment, the assessor validates that the entity
accurately defined and documented the scope of the assessment.


_**Note**_ _: This annual confirmation of PCI DSS scope is defined at PCI DSS Requirement at 12.5.2 and is an activity expected to be performed by_
_the entity. This activity is not the same, nor is it intended to be replaced by, the scoping confirmation performed by the entity’s assessor during_
_the assessment._

#### **Segmentation**


Segmentation (or isolation) of the CDE from the remainder of an entity’s network is not a PCI DSS requirement. However, it is strongly
recommended as a method that may reduce the:


   - Scope of the PCI DSS assessment


   - Cost of the PCI DSS assessment


   - Cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls


   - Risk to an organization relative to payment account data (reduced by consolidating that data into fewer, more controlled locations)


Without adequate segmentation (sometimes called a "flat network"), the entire network is in scope for the PCI DSS assessment. Segmentation
can be achieved using a number of physical or logical methods, such as properly configured internal network security controls, routers with
strong access control lists, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular segment of a network. To be considered out of scope for
PCI DSS, a system component must be properly segmented (isolated) from the CDE, such that the out-of-scope system component could not
impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data, even if that component was compromised.


An important prerequisite to reduce the scope of the CDE is a clear understanding of business needs and processes related to the storage,
processing, and transmission of account data. Restricting account data to as few locations as possible by eliminating unnecessary data and
consolidating necessary data may require reengineering of long-standing business practices.

Documenting account data flows via a data-flow diagram helps an entity fully understand how account data comes into an organization, where
it resides within the organization, and how it traverses through various systems within the organization. Data-flow diagrams also illustrate all
locations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted. This information supports an entity implementing segmentation and can
also support confirming that segmentation is being used to isolate the CDE from out-of-scope networks.


If segmentation is used to reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the segmentation is adequate to
reduce the scope of the assessment, as illustrated in Figure 2. At a high level, adequate segmentation isolates systems that store, process, or
transmit account data from those that do not. However, the adequacy of a specific segmentation implementation is highly variable and
depends on several factors such as a given network's configuration, the technologies deployed, and other controls that may be implemented.


**Figure 2. Segmentation and Impact to PCI DSS Scope**

_©2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved._ _Page 13_


#### **Wireless**

If wireless technology is used to store, process, or transmit account data (for example, wireless point-of-sale devices), or if a wireless local
area network (WLAN) is part of or connected to the CDE, the PCI DSS requirements and testing procedures for securing wireless
environments apply and must be performed.


Rogue wireless detection must be performed per PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.1 even when wireless is not used within the CDE and the entity
has a policy that prohibits the use of wireless technology within its environment. This is because of the ease with which a wireless access
point can be attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting its presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices.


Before wireless technology is implemented, an entity should carefully evaluate the need for the technology against the risk. Consider
deploying wireless technology only for non-sensitive data transmission.

#### **When Cardholder Data and/or Sensitive Authentication Data is Accidentally Received via an** **Unintended Channel**


There could be occurrences where an entity receives cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data unsolicited via an insecure
communication channel that was not intended for the purpose of receiving sensitive data. In this situation, the entity can choose to either:


    - Include the channel in the scope of their CDE and secure it according to PCI DSS


Or


    - Securely delete the data and implement measures to prevent the channel from being used in the future for sending such data.

#### **Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact on PCI DSS Scope**


Encryption of cardholder data with strong cryptography is an acceptable method of rendering the data unreadable according to PCI DSS
Requirement 3.5. However, encryption alone is generally insufficient to render the cardholder data out of scope for PCI DSS and does not
remove the need for PCI DSS in that environment. The entity’s environment is still in scope for PCI DSS due to the presence of cardholder
data. For example, for a merchant card-present environment, there is physical access to the payment cards to complete a transaction and
there may also be paper reports or receipts with cardholder data. Similarly, in merchant card-not-present environments, such as mailorder/telephone-order and e-commerce, payment card details are provided via channels that need to be evaluated and protected according to
PCI DSS.


The following are each in scope for PCI DSS:


   - Systems performing encryption and/or decryption of cardholder data, and systems performing key management functions,


   - Encrypted cardholder data that is not isolated from the encryption and decryption and key management processes,

   - Encrypted cardholder data that is present on a system or media that also contains the decryption key,


   - Encrypted cardholder data that is present in the same environment as the decryption key,


   - Encrypted cardholder data that is accessible to an entity that also has access to the decryption key.


_**Note**_ _: A PCI-listed P2PE solution can significantly reduce the number of PCI DSS requirements applicable to a merchant’s cardholder data_
_environment. However, it does not completely remove the applicability of PCI DSS in the merchant environment._

#### **Encrypted Cardholder Data and Impact to PCI DSS Scope for Third-Party Service Providers**


Where a third-party service provider (TPSP) receives and/or stores only data encrypted by another entity, and where they do not have the
ability to decrypt the data, the TPSP may be able to consider the encrypted data out of scope if certain conditions are met. This is because
responsibility for the data generally remains with the entity, or entities, with the ability to decrypt the data or impact the security of the
encrypted data. Determining which party is responsible for specific PCI DSS controls will depend on several factors, including who has access
to the decryption keys, the role performed by each party, and the agreement between parties. Responsibilities should be clearly defined and
documented to ensure both the TPSP and the entity providing the encrypted data understand which entity is responsible for which security
controls.


As an example, a TPSP providing storage services receives and stores encrypted cardholder data provided by customers for back-up
purposes. This TPSP does not have access to the encryption or decryption keys, nor does it perform any key management for its customers.
The TPSP can exclude any such encrypted data when determining its PCI DSS scope. However, the TPSP does maintain responsibility for
controlling access to the encrypted data storage as part of its service agreements with its customers.


Responsibility for ensuring that the encrypted data and the cryptographic keys are protected according to applicable PCI DSS requirements is
often shared between entities. In the above example, the customer determines which of their personnel are authorized to access the storage
media, and the storage facility is responsible for managing the physical and/or logical access controls to ensure that only persons authorized
by the customer are granted access to the storage media. The specific PCI DSS requirements applicable to a TPSP will depend on the
services provided and the agreement between the two parties. In the example of a TPSP providing storage services, the physical and logical
access controls provided by the TPSP will need to be reviewed at least annually. This review could be performed as part of the merchant’s
PCI DSS assessment or, alternatively, the review could be performed, and controls validated, by the TPSP with appropriate evidence provided
to the merchant. For information about “appropriate evidence,” see _Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services_
_that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS Requirements._


As another example, a TPSP that receives only encrypted cardholder data for the purposes of routing to other entities, and that does not have
access to the data or cryptographic keys, may not have any PCI DSS responsibility for that encrypted data. In this scenario, where the TPSP
is not providing any security services or access controls, they may be considered the same as a public or untrusted network, and it would be
the responsibility of the entity(s) sending/receiving account data through the TPSP’s network to ensure PCI DSS controls are applied to
protect the data being transmitted.

#### **Use of Third-Party Service Providers**

An entity (referred to as the “customer” in this section) might choose to use a third-party service provider (TPSP) to store, process, or transmit
account data or to manage in-scope system components on the customer’s behalf. Use of a TPSP may have an impact on the security of a
customer’s CDE.


_**Note**_ _: Use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make a customer PCI DSS compliant, nor does it remove the customer’s responsibility for_
_its own PCI DSS compliance. Even if a customer uses a TPSP, that customer remains responsible for confirming its own compliance as_
_requested by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers). Customers should contact these_
_organizations for any requirements._


_**Using TPSPs and the Impact on Customers Meeting PCI DSS Requirement 12.8**_


There are many different scenarios where a customer might use one or more TPSPs for functions within or related to the customer’s CDE.
In all scenarios where a TPSP is used, the customer must manage and oversee all their TPSP relationships and monitor the PCI DSS
compliance status of their TPSPs in accordance with Requirement 12.8, including TPSPs that:


    - Have access to the customer’s CDE,


    - Manage in-scope system components on the customer’s behalf, and/or


    - Can impact the security of the customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.


Managing TPSP relationships in accordance with Requirement 12.8 includes performing due diligence, having appropriate agreements in
place, identifying which requirements apply to the customer and which apply to the TPSP, and monitoring the compliance status of TPSPs
at least annually.


Requirement 12.8 does not specify that the customer’s TPSPs must be PCI DSS compliant, only that the customer monitors their
compliance status as specified in the requirement. Therefore, a TPSP does not need to be PCI DSS compliant for its customer to meet
Requirement 12.8.

_**Impact of Using TPSPs for Services that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS Requirements**_


When the TPSP provides a service that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer’s behalf or where that service may impact the
security of the customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data, then those requirements are in scope for the customer’s
assessment and the compliance of that service will impact the customer’s PCI DSS compliance. The TPSP must demonstrate it meets
applicable PCI DSS requirements for those requirements to be in place for its customers. For example, if an entity engages a TPSP to
manage its network security controls, and the TPSP does not provide evidence that it meets the applicable requirements in PCI DSS
Requirement 1, then those requirements are not in place for the customer’s assessment. As another example, TPSPs that store backups of
cardholder data on behalf of customers would need to meet the applicable requirements related to access controls, physical security, etc.,
for their customers to consider those requirements in place for their assessments.


_**Importance of Understanding Responsibilities Between TPSP Customers and TPSPs**_


When a TPSP provides a service that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer’s behalf or where that service may impact the
security of the customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data, it is important that customers and TPSPs clearly identify and
understand the following:


    - The services and system components included in the scope of the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment,


    - The specific PCI DSS requirements and sub-requirements covered by the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment,


    - Any requirements that are the responsibility of the TPSP’s customers to include in their own PCI DSS assessments, and


    - Any PCI DSS requirements for which the responsibility is shared between the TPSP and its customers.


For example, a cloud provider should clearly define which of its IP addresses are scanned as part of its quarterly vulnerability scan process
and which IP addresses are their customers’ responsibility to scan.


Per Requirement 12.9.2, TPSPs are required to support their customers’ requests for information about the TPSP’s PCI DSS compliance
status related to the services provided to customers, and about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the TPSP, which are
the responsibility of the customer, and any responsibilities shared between the customer and the TPSP. Refer to _Information Supplement:_
_Third-Party Security Assurance_ for a sample responsibility matrix template that may be used for documenting and clarifying how
responsibilities are shared between TPSPs and customers.


_Note that not all TPSP relationships require that TPSPs provide customers with documentation of how responsibilities are shared between TPSPs_
_and customers. TPSPs are only required to share such documentation if that TPSP is meeting a PCI DSS requirement(s) on the customer’s behalf,_
_if responsibility for meeting a PCI DSS requirement is shared between the TPSP and its customer, or if the TPSP’s service may impact the security_
_of the customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. While a TPSP may not be required to provide its customers with such_
_documentation because there are no shared responsibilities, the TPSP still needs to support customers by providing their PCI DSS compliance_
_status information, so that customers can manage and monitor their TPSPs in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 12.8._

_**Options for TPSPs to Validate PCI DSS Compliance for TPSP Services that Meet Customers’ PCI DSS**_
_**Requirements**_


TPSPs are responsible for demonstrating their PCI DSS compliance as requested by organizations that manage compliance programs (for
example, payment brands and acquirers). TPSPs should contact these organizations for any requirements.


When a TPSP provides services that are intended to meet or facilitate meeting a customer’s PCI DSS requirements or that may impact the
security of a customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data, these requirements are in scope for the customer’s PCI DSS
assessments. There are two options for TPSPs to validate compliance in this scenario:


    - **Annual assessment** : TPSP undergoes an annual PCI DSS assessment(s) and provides evidence to its customers to show the TPSP
meets the applicable PCI DSS requirements; or


    - **Multiple, on-demand assessments** : If a TPSP does not undergo an annual PCI DSS assessment, it must undergo assessments
upon request of their customers and/or participate in each of its customers’ PCI DSS assessments, with the results of each review
provided to the respective customer(s).


If the TPSP undergoes its own PCI DSS assessment, it is expected to provide sufficient evidence to its customers to verify that the scope of
the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer, and that the relevant PCI DSS requirements were
examined and determined to be in place. If the provider has an PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), it is expected that the TPSP
provides the AOC to customers upon request. The customer may also request relevant sections of the TPSP’s PCI DSS Report on
Compliance (ROC). The ROC may be redacted to protect any confidential information.


If the TPSP does not undergo its own PCI DSS assessment and therefore does not have an AOC, the TPSP is expected to provide specific
evidence related to the applicable PCI DSS requirements, so that the customer (or its assessor) is able to confirm that the TPSP is meeting
those PCI DSS requirements.


_**TPSP’s Presence on a Payment Brand List(s) of PCI DSS Compliant Service Providers**_


For a customer that is monitoring a TPSP’s compliance status in accordance with Requirement 12.8, the TPSP’s presence on a payment
brand’s list of PCI DSS compliant service providers _**may be sufficient evidence**_ of the TPSP’s compliance status if it is clear from the list
that the services applicable to the customer were covered by the TPSP’s PCI DSS assessment. If it is not clear from the list, the customer
should obtain other written confirmation that addresses the TPSP’s PCI DSS compliance status.


For a customer that is looking for evidence of PCI DSS compliance for requirements that a TPSP meets on a customer’s behalf or where
the service provided can impact the security of the customer’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data, the TPSP’s presence
on a payment brand’s list of PCI DSS compliant service providers _**is not sufficient evidence**_ that the applicable PCI DSS requirements for
that TPSP were included in the assessment. If the TPSP has an PCI DSS AOC, it is expected to provide it to customers upon request.

### **5 Best Practices for Implementing PCI DSS into Business-as-Usual Processes**

An entity that implements business-as-usual processes, otherwise known as BAU, as part of their overall security strategy is taking measures
to ensure that the security controls implemented to secure data and an environment continue to be implemented correctly and functioning
properly as normal course of business.


Some PCI DSS requirements are intended to act as BAU processes by monitoring security controls to ensure their effectiveness on an
ongoing basis. This oversight by the entity assists with providing reasonable assurance that the compliance of its environment is preserved
between PCI DSS assessments. While there are currently some BAU requirements defined within the standard, an entity should adopt
additional BAU processes specific to their organization and environment when possible. BAU processes are a way to verify that automated
and manual controls are performing as expected. Regardless of whether a PCI DSS requirement is automated or manual, it is important for
BAU processes to detect anomalies, and alert and report so that responsible individuals address the situation in a timely manner.


Examples of how PCI DSS should be incorporated into BAU activities include, but are not limited to:


   - Assigning overall responsibility and accountability for PCI DSS compliance to an individual or team. This can include a charter defined
by executive management for a specific PCI DSS compliance program and communication to executive management.


   - Developing performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of security initiatives and continuous monitoring of security controls,
including those that are heavily relied upon, such as network security controls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention systems
(IDS/IPS), change-detection mechanisms, anti-malware solutions, and access controls, to ensure they are operating effectively and as
intended.


   - Reviewing logged data more frequently to gain insights to trends or behaviors that may not be obvious with only monitoring.


   - Ensuring that all failures in security controls are detected and responded to promptly. Processes to respond to security control failures
should include:


– Restoring the security control.


– Identifying the cause of failure.


– Identifying and addressing any security issues that arose during the failure of the security control.


– Implementing mitigation, such as process or technical controls, to prevent the cause of the failure from recurring.


– Resuming monitoring of the security control, perhaps with enhanced monitoring for a period of time, to verify the control is operating
effectively.

   - Reviewing changes that could introduce security risks to the environment (for example, addition of new systems, changes in system or
network configurations) prior to completing the change, and including the following:


– Perform a risk assessment to determine the potential impact to PCI DSS scope (for example, a new network security control rule
that permits connectivity between a system in the CDE and another system could bring additional systems or networks into scope
for PCI DSS).


– Identify PCI DSS requirements applicable to systems and networks affected by the changes (for example, if a new system is in
scope for PCI DSS, it would need to be configured per system configuration standards, including change-detection mechanisms,
anti-malware software, patches, and audit logging. These new systems and networks would need to be added to the inventory of inscope system components and to the quarterly vulnerability scan schedule).


– Update PCI DSS scope and implement security controls as appropriate.


– Update documentation to reflect implemented changes.


   - Reviewing the impact to PCI DSS scope and requirements upon changes to organizational structure (for example, a company merger
or acquisition).


   - Reviewing external connections and third-party access periodically.


   - For entities that use third parties for software development, periodically confirming that those software development activities continue
to comply with software development requirements in Requirement 6.


   - Performing periodic reviews to confirm that PCI DSS requirements continue to be in place and personnel follow established processes.
Periodic reviews should cover all facilities and locations, including retail outlets and data centers, whether self-managed or if a TPSP is
used. For example, periodic reviews can be used to confirm that configuration standards have been applied to applicable systems,
default vendor accounts and passwords are removed or disabled, patches and anti-malware solutions are up to date, audit logs are
being reviewed, and so on. The frequency of periodic reviews should be determined by the entity as appropriate for the size and
complexity of their environment, if not otherwise stated in PCI DSS.


These reviews can also be used to verify that required evidence for a PCI DSS assessment is being maintained. For example, evidence of
audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, and reviews of network security control rulesets are necessary to assist the entity in preparing for its next
PCI DSS assessment.


   - Establishing communication with all impacted parties, both external and internal, about newly identified threats and changes to the
organization structure. Communication materials should help recipients understand the impact of threats, mitigating steps, and contact
points for further information or escalation.

   - Reviewing hardware and software technologies at least once every 12 months to confirm that they continue to be supported by the
vendor and can meet the entity’s security requirements, including PCI DSS. If technologies are no longer supported by the vendor or
cannot meet the entity’s security needs, the entity should prepare a remediation plan, including replacement of the technology, as

necessary.


_**Note**_ _: Some best practices in this section are also included as PCI DSS requirements for certain entities. For example, those undergoing a full_
_PCI DSS assessment, service providers validating to the additional “service provider only” requirements, and designated entities that are_
_required to validate according to Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation._


_Each entity should consider implementing these best practices into their environment, even if the entity is not required to validate to them (for_
_example, merchants undergoing self-assessment)._


Refer to _Best Practices for Maintaining PCI DSS Compliance_ in the Document Library on the PCI SSC website for additional guidance.

### **6 For Assessors: Sampling for PCI DSS Assessments**

Sampling is an option for assessors conducting PCI DSS assessments to facilitate the assessment process when there are large numbers of
items in a population being tested.


While it is acceptable for an assessor to sample from similar items in a population being tested as part of its review of an entity’s PCI DSS
compliance, it is not acceptable for an entity to apply PCI DSS requirements to only a sample of its environment (for example, requirements for
quarterly vulnerability scans apply to all system components). Similarly, it is not acceptable for an assessor to review only a sample of PCI
DSS requirements for compliance.


While sampling allows assessors to test less than 100% of a given sampling population, assessors should always strive for the most complete
review possible. Assessors are encouraged to use automated processes or other mechanisms if the complete population, regardless of size,
can be tested quickly and efficiently with minimal impact on the resources of the entity being assessed. Where automated processes are not
available to test 100% of a population, sampling is an equally acceptable approach.


After considering the overall scope, complexity, and consistency of the environment being assessed, and the nature (automated or manual) of
the processes used by an entity to meet a requirement, the assessor may independently select representative samples from the populations
being reviewed in order to assess the entity’s compliance with PCI DSS requirements. Samples must be a representative selection of all
variants of the population and must be sufficiently large to provide the assessor with assurance that controls are implemented as expected
across the entire population. Where testing the periodic performance of a requirement (for example, weekly or quarterly, or periodically), the
assessor should attempt to select a sample that represents the entire period covered by the assessment so that the assessor may make a
reasonable judgment that the requirement was met throughout the assessment period. Testing the same sample of items year after year could
allow unknown variations in the non-sampled items to remain undetected. Assessors must revalidate the sampling rationale for each
assessment and consider previous sample sets. Different samples must be selected for each assessment.


Appropriate selection of the sample depends on what is being considered in examining the sample members. For example, determining the
presence of anti-malware on servers known to be affected by malicious software may lead to determining the population to be all servers in
the environment, or all servers in the environment that are running a particular operating system, or all servers that are not mainframes, etc.
Selection of an appropriate sample would then include representatives of ALL members of the identified population, including all servers
running the identified operating system including all versions, as well as servers within the population that are used for different functions (for
example, web servers, application servers, and database servers).


In the case that a specific configuration item is being considered, the population might be appropriately divided, and separate sample groups
identified. For example, a sample of all servers may not be appropriate when reviewing an operating system configuration setting, where
different operating systems are present within the environment. In this case, samples from each operating system type would be appropriate in
identifying that the configuration has been appropriately set for each operating system. Each sample set should include servers that are
representative of each operating system type, including version, as well as representative functions.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1_ _June 2024_
_©2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved._ _Page 22_


Other examples of sampling include selections of personnel with similar or varied roles, based on the requirement being assessed, for
example, a sample of administrators vs. a sample of all employees.


The assessor is required to use professional judgment in the planning, performance, and evaluation of the sample to support their conclusion
about whether and how the entity has met a requirement. The assessor’s goal in sampling is to obtain enough evidence to have a reasonable
basis for their opinion. When independently selecting samples, assessors should consider the following:


   - The assessor must select the sample from the complete population without influence from the assessed entity.


   - If the entity has standardized processes and controls in place that ensure consistency and which is applied to each item in the
population, the sample can be smaller than if the entity has no standardized processes/controls in place. The sample must be large
enough to provide the assessor with reasonable assurance that items in the population adhere to the standardized processes that are
applied to each item in the population. The assessor must verify that the standardized controls are implemented and working effectively.


   - If the entity has more than one type of standardized process in place (for example, for different types of business facilities/system
components), the sample must include items subject to each type of process. For example, populations could be divided into subpopulations based on characteristics that may impact the consistency of the assessed requirements, such as the use of different
processes or tools. Samples would then be selected from each sub-population.


   - If the entity has no standardized PCI DSS processes/controls in place and each item in the population is managed through nonstandardized processes, the sample must be larger for the assessor to be assured that the PCI DSS requirements are appropriately
applied to each item in the population.


   - Samples of system components must include every type and combination being used. When an entity has more than one CDE,
samples must include populations across all in-scope system components. For example, where applications are sampled, the sample
must include all versions and platforms for each type of application.


   - Sample sizes must always be greater than one unless there is only one item in the given population, or an automated control is used
where the assessor has confirmed the control is functioning as programmed for each assessed sample population.


   - If the assessor relies on standardized processes and controls being in place as a basis for selecting a sample, but then finds out during
testing that standardized processes and controls are not in place or not operating effectively, the assessor should then increase the
sample size to attempt to gain assurance that PCI DSS requirements are being met.


For each instance where sampling is used, the assessor must:


   - Document the rationale behind the sampling technique and sample size.


   - Validate and document the standardized processes and controls used to determine sample size.


   - Explain how the sample is appropriate and representative of the overall population.

Figure 3 shows considerations for determining sample size.


**Figure 3. PCI DSS Sampling Considerations**


_**Note**_ _: In PCI DSS v4.0, specific references to sampling have been removed from all testing procedures. These references were removed_
_because calling out sampling only in some testing procedures may have implied that sampling was mandatory for those testing procedures_
_(which it was not) or that sampling was only allowable where it was specifically mentioned. Assessors should select samples when it is_
_appropriate to the population being tested, and, per above, render those decisions after considering the overall scope and complexity of an_
_environment._

### **7 Description of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS Requirements**

Certain PCI DSS requirements have been established with specific timeframes for activities that need to be performed consistently via a
regularly scheduled and repeatable process. The intent is that the activity is performed at an interval as close to that timeframe as possible
without exceeding it. The entity has the discretion to perform an activity more often than specified (for example, performing an activity monthly
where the PCI DSS requirement specifies it be performed every three months).


Table 4 outlines the frequency for the different time periods used in PCI DSS Requirements.


**Table 4. PCI DSS Requirement Timeframes**



















|Timeframes in PCI DSS<br>Requirements|Descriptions and Examples|
|---|---|
|Daily|Every day of the year (not only on business days).|
|Weekly|At least once every seven days.|
|Monthly|At least once every 30 to 31 days, or on the nth day of the month.|
|Every three months<br>(“quarterly”)|At least once every 90 to 92 days, or on the nth day of each third month.|
|Every six months|At least once every 180 to 184 days, or on the nth day of each sixth month.|
|Every 12 months<br>(“annually”)|At least once every 365 (or 366 for leap years) days or on the same date every year.|
|Periodically|Frequency of occurrence is at the entity’s discretion and is documented and supported by the entity’s risk analysis. The entity<br>must demonstrate that the frequency is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent of the requirement.|
|Immediately|Without delay. In real time or near real time.|
|Promptly|As soon as reasonably possible.|


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1_ _June 2024_
_©2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved._ _Page 25_


|Timeframes in PCI DSS<br>Requirements|Descriptions and Examples|
|---|---|
|Significant change<br>|There are several requirements that specify activities to be performed upon a significant change in an entity’s environment.<br>While what constitutes a significant change is highly dependent on the configuration of a given environment, each of the<br>following activities, at a minimum, has potential impacts on the security of the CDE and must be considered and evaluated to<br>determine whether a change is a significant change for an entity in the context of related PCI DSS requirements:<br>• <br>New hardware, software, or networking equipment added to the CDE.<br>• <br>Any replacement or major upgrades of hardware and/or software in the CDE.<br>• <br>Any changes in the flow or storage of account data.<br>• <br>Any changes to the boundary of the CDE and/or to the scope of the PCI DSS assessment.<br>• <br>Any changes to the underlying supporting infrastructure of the CDE (including, but not limited to, changes to directory<br>services, time servers, logging, and monitoring).<br>• <br>Any changes to third-party vendors/service providers (or services provided) that support the CDE or meet PCI DSS<br>requirements on behalf of the entity.|


For other PCI DSS requirements, where the standard does not define a minimum frequency for recurring activities but instead allows for the
requirement to be met “periodically,” the entity is expected to define the frequency as appropriate for its business. The frequency defined by
the entity must be supported by the entity’s security policy and the risk analysis conducted according to PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.1. The
entity must also be able to demonstrate that the frequency it has defined is appropriate for the activity to be effective and to meet the intent of
the requirement.


In both cases, where PCI DSS specifies a required frequency and where PCI DSS allows for “periodic” performance, the entity is expected to
have documented and implemented processes to ensure that activities are performed within a reasonable timeframe, including at least the
following:


   - The entity is promptly notified any time an activity is not performed per its defined schedule,


   - The entity determines the events that led to missing a scheduled activity,


   - The entity performs the activity as soon as possible after it is missed and either gets back on schedule or establishes a new schedule,


   - The entity produces documentation that shows the above elements occurred.


When an entity has the above processes in place to detect and address when a scheduled activity is missed, a reasonable approach is
allowable, meaning that if an activity is required to be performed at least once every three months, the entity is not automatically noncompliant if the activity is performed late where the entity’s documented and implemented process (per above) was followed. However, where
no such process is in place and/or the activity was not performed according to schedule due to oversight, mismanagement, or lack of


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1_ _June 2024_
_©2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All Rights Reserved._ _Page 26_


monitoring, the entity has not met the requirement. In such cases, the requirement will only be in place when the entity 1) documents (or
reconfirms) the process per above to ensure the scheduled activity occurs on time, 2) re-establishes the schedule, and 3) provides evidence
that the entity has performed the scheduled activity at least once per their schedule.

### **8 Approaches for Implementing and Validating PCI DSS**

To support flexibility in how security objectives are met, there are two approaches for implementing and validating to PCI DSS. Entities should
identify the approach best suited to their security implementation and use that approach to validate the controls.















|Defined<br>Approach|Follows the traditional method for implementing and validating PCI DSS and uses the Requirements and Testing Procedures<br>defined within the standard. In the defined approach, the entity implements security controls to meet the stated requirements,<br>and the assessor follows the defined testing procedures to verify that requirements have been met.<br>The defined approach supports entities with controls in place that meet PCI DSS requirements as stated. This approach may<br>also suit entities that want more direction about how to meet security objectives, as well as entities new to information security<br>or PCI DSS.<br>Compensating Controls<br>As part of the defined approach, entities that cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as<br>Note: For more details,<br>stated due to a legitimate and documented technical or business constraint may implement<br>see Appendix B:<br>other, or compensating, controls, that sufficiently mitigate the risk associated with not meeting<br>Compensating Controls<br>the requirement. On an annual basis, any compensating controls must be documented by the<br>and Appendix C:<br>entity and reviewed and validated by the assessor and included with the Report on<br>Compensating Controls<br>Compliance submission.<br>Worksheet.|
|---|---|
|**Customized**<br>**Approach**|Focuses on the Objective of each PCI DSS requirement (if applicable), allowing entities to<br>implement controls to meet the requirement’s stated Customized Approach Objective in a way<br>that does not strictly follow the defined requirement.

Most PCI DSS requirements can be met using either the defined or customized approach. However, several requirements do not have a
stated Customized Approach Objective; the customized approach is not an option for these requirements.


Entities can use both the defined and customized approaches within their environment. This means an entity could use the defined approach
to meet some requirements and use the customized approach to meet other requirements. This also means that an entity could use the
defined approach to meet a given PCI DSS requirement for one system component or within one environment and use the customized
approach to meet that same PCI DSS requirement for a different system component or within a different environment. In this way, a PCI DSS
assessment could include both defined and customized testing procedures.


Figure 4 shows the two validation options for PCI DSS v4.x.

### **9 Protecting Information About an Entity’s Security Posture**

The processes related to becoming and maintaining a PCI DSS compliant environment results in many artifacts that an entity may consider
sensitive and may want to protect as such, including such items as the following:


   - The Report on Compliance or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (the associated Attestation of Compliance is not considered sensitive and
third-party service providers (TPSPs) are expected to share their AOC with customers).


   - Network diagrams and account data-flow diagrams, and security configurations and rules.


   - System configuration standards.


   - Cryptography and key management methods and protocols.


Entities should review all the artifacts related to PCI DSS controls or the assessment and protect them in accordance with the entity’s security
policies for this type of information.


TPSPs are required (PCI DSS Requirement 12.9) to support their customers with the following:


   - Information needed for customers to monitor the TPSPs’ PCI DSS compliance status (to enable the customer to comply with
Requirement 12.8), and


   - Evidence that the TPSP is meeting applicable PCI DSS requirements where the TPSP’s services are intended to meet or facilitate
meeting a customer’s PCI DSS requirements, or where those services may impact the security of a customer’s cardholder data and/or
sensitive authentication data.


This section does not impact or negate a TPSP’s obligation to support and provide information to their customers per Requirement 12.9.


For more details about expectations for TPSPs and relationships between TPSPs and customers, see _Use of Third-Party Service Providers_ .


_**Protection of Confidential and Sensitive Information by Qualified Security Assessor Companies**_


Each Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) Company signs an agreement with PCI SSC that they will adhere to the Qualification Requirements
for QSAs. The _Protection of Confidential and Sensitive Information_ section of that document includes the following:


“The QSA company must have and adhere to a documented process for protection of confidential and sensitive information. This must
include adequate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards consistent with industry-accepted practices to protect confidential and
sensitive information against any threats or unauthorized access during storage, processing, and/or communicating of this information.


“The QSA Company must maintain the privacy and confidentiality of information obtained in the course of performing its duties and
obligations as a QSA Company, unless (and to the extent) disclosure is required by legal authority.”

### **10 Testing Methods for PCI DSS Requirements**

The testing methods identified in the Testing Procedures for each requirement describe the expected activities to be performed by the
assessor to determine whether the entity has met the requirement. The intent behind each testing method is described as follows:


   - Examine: The assessor critically evaluates data evidence. Common examples include documents (electronic or physical), screenshots,
configuration files, audit logs, and data files.


   - Observe: The assessor watches an action or views something in the environment. Examples of observation subjects include personnel
performing a task or process, system components performing a function or responding to input, environmental conditions, and physical
controls.


   - Interview: The assessor converses with individual personnel. Interview objectives may include confirmation of whether an activity is
performed, descriptions of how an activity is performed, and whether personnel have particular knowledge or understanding.


The testing methods are intended to allow the assessed entity to demonstrate how they have met a requirement. They also provide the
assessed entity and the assessor with a common understanding of the assessment activities to be performed. The specific items to be
examined or observed and personnel to be interviewed should be appropriate for both the requirement being assessed and each entity’s
particular implementation. When documenting the assessment results, the assessor identifies the testing activities performed and the result of
each activity.

### **11 Instructions and Content for Report on Compliance**

Instructions and content for the Report on Compliance (ROC) are provided in the _PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template_ .


The PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template must be used as the template for creating a PCI DSS Report on Compliance.


Whether any entity is required to comply with or validate their compliance to PCI DSS is at the discretion of those organizations that manage
compliance programs (such as payment brands and acquirers). Entities should contact these organizations to determine any reporting
requirements and instructions.

### **12 PCI DSS Assessment Process**

The PCI DSS assessment process includes the following high-level steps: [5]


1. Confirm the scope of the PCI DSS assessment.


2. Perform the PCI DSS assessment of the environment.


3. Complete the applicable report for the assessment according to PCI DSS guidance and instructions.


4. Complete the Attestation of Compliance for Service Providers or Merchants, as applicable, in its entirety. Official Attestations of
Compliance are only available on the PCI SSC website.


5. Submit the applicable PCI SSC documentation and the Attestation of Compliance, along with any other requested documentation—
such as ASV scan reports—to the requesting organization (those that manage compliance programs such as payment brands and
acquirers (for merchants), or other requesters (for service providers)).


6. If required, perform remediation to address requirements that are not in place and provide an updated report.











5 The PCI DSS assessment process, and the roles and responsibilities for completion of each step, vary depending on the type of assessment and on compliance
programs, which are managed by payment brands and acquirers.

_**Additional Requirements for Service Providers Only**_


Some requirements apply only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. These are identified within the requirement as “ _Additional_
_requirement for service providers only”_ and apply in addition to all other applicable requirements. Where the entity being assessed is both a
merchant and a service provider, requirements noted as “ _Additional requirement for service providers only”_ apply to the service provider
portion of the entity’s business. Requirements identified with “ _Additional requirement for service providers only”_ are also recommended as best
practices for consideration by all entities.


_**Appendices with Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Different Types of Entities**_


In addition to the 12 principal requirements, PCI DSS Appendix A contains additional PCI DSS requirements for different types of entities. The
sections within Appendix A include:


   - Appendix A1: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Multi-Tenant Service Providers.


   - Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities using SSL/Early TLS for Card-Present POS POI Terminal Connections.


   - Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV).

**Overview**


Network security controls (NSCs), such as firewalls and other network security technologies, are network policy enforcement points that
typically control network traffic between two or more logical or physical network segments (or subnets) based on pre-defined _policies_ or _rules_ .


NSCs examine all network traffic entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) a segment and decide, based on the policies defined, whether the
network traffic is allowed to pass or whether it should be rejected. Typically, NSCs are placed between environments with different security
needs or levels of trust, however in some environments NSCs control the traffic to individual devices irrespective of trust boundaries. Policy
enforcement generally occurs at layer 3 of the OSI model, but data present in higher layers is also frequently used to determine policy
decisions.


Traditionally this function has been provided by physical firewalls; however, now this functionality may be provided by virtual devices, cloud
access controls, virtualization/container systems, and other software-defined networking technology.


NSCs are used to control traffic within an entity’s own networks—for example, between highly sensitive and less sensitive areas—and also to
protect the entity’s resources from exposure to untrusted networks. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is an example of a more sensitive
area within an entity’s network. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from untrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into
sensitive systems. NSCs provide a key protection mechanism for any computer network.


Common examples of untrusted networks include the Internet, dedicated connections such as business-to-business communication channels,
wireless networks, carrier networks (such as cellular), third-party networks, and other sources outside the entity’s ability to control. Furthermore,
untrusted networks also include corporate networks that are considered out-of-scope for PCI DSS, because they are not assessed, and
therefore must be treated as untrusted because the existence of security controls has not been verified. While an entity may consider an
internal network to be trusted from an infrastructure perspective, if a network is out of scope for PCI DSS, that network must be considered
untrusted for PCI DSS.


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

_**Requirement 2: Apply Secure Configurations to All System Components**_


**Sections**


**2.1** Processes and mechanisms for applying secure configurations to all system components are defined and understood.


**2.2** System components are configured and managed securely.


**2.3** Wireless environments are configured and managed securely.


**Overview**


Malicious individuals, both external and internal to an entity, often use default passwords and other vendor default settings to compromise
systems. These passwords and settings are well known and are easily determined via public information.


Applying secure configurations to system components reduces the means available to an attacker to compromise the system. Changing default
passwords, removing unnecessary software, functions, and accounts, and disabling or removing unnecessary services all help to reduce the
potential attack surface.


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

#### **Protect Account Data**

_**Requirement 3: Protect Stored Account Data**_


**Sections**


**3.1** Processes and mechanisms for protecting stored account data are defined and understood.


**3.2** Storage of account data is kept to a minimum.


**3.3** Sensitive authentication data (SAD) is not stored after authorization.


**3.4** Access to displays of full PAN and ability to copy PAN are restricted.


**3.5** Primary account number (PAN) is secured wherever it is stored.


**3.6** Cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data are secured.


**3.7** Where cryptography is used to protect stored account data, key management processes and procedures covering all aspects of the key
lifecycle are defined and implemented.


**Overview**


Protection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are critical components of account data protection. If an intruder
circumvents other security controls and gains access to encrypted account data, the data is unreadable without the proper cryptographic keys
and is unusable to that intruder. Other effective methods of protecting stored data should also be considered as potential risk-mitigation
opportunities. For example, methods for minimizing risk include not storing account data unless necessary, truncating cardholder data if full
PAN is not needed, and not sending unprotected PANs using end-user messaging technologies such as e-mail and instant messaging.


If account data is present in non-persistent memory (for example, RAM, volatile memory), encryption of PAN is not required. However, proper
controls must be in place to ensure that memory maintains a non-persistent state. Data should be removed from volatile memory once the
business purpose (for example, the associated transaction) is complete. In the case that data storage becomes persistent, all applicable PCI
DSS Requirements will apply including encryption of stored data.


Requirement 3 applies to protection of stored account data unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of “strong cryptography” and other PCI DSS terms.

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>A formal data retention policy identifies what data<br>needs to be retained, for how long, and where that data<br>resides so it can be securely destroyed or deleted as<br>soon as it is no longer needed. The only account data<br>that may be stored after authorization is the primary<br>account number or PAN (rendered unreadable),<br>expiration date, cardholder name, and service code.<br>The storage of SAD data prior to the completion of the<br>authorization process is also included in the data<br>retention and disposal policy so that storage of this<br>sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained for<br>the defined amount of time.<br>**Good Practice**<br>When identifying locations of stored account data,<br>consider all processes and personnel with access to<br>the data, as data could have been moved and stored in<br>different locations than originally defined. Storage<br>locations that are often overlooked include backup and<br>archive systems, removable data storage devices,<br>paper-based media, and audio recordings.<br>To define appropriate retention requirements, an entity<br>first needs to understand its own business needs as<br>well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to<br>its industry or to the type of data being retained.<br>Implementing an automated process to ensure data is<br>automatically and securely deleted upon its defined<br>retention limit can help ensure that account data is not<br>retained beyond what is necessary for business, legal,<br>or regulatory purposes.<br>_(continued on next page)_|

|**Applicability Notes**||Methods of eliminating data when it exceeds the<br>retention period include secure deletion to complete<br>removal of the data or rendering it unrecoverable and<br>unable to be reconstructed. Identifying and securely<br>eliminating stored data that has exceeded its specified<br>retention period prevents unnecessary retention of data<br>that is no longer needed. This process may be<br>automated, manual, or a combination of both.<br>The deletion function in most operating systems is not<br>“secure deletion” as it allows deleted data to be<br>recovered, so instead, a dedicated secure deletion<br>function or application must be used to make data<br>unrecoverable.<br>_Remember, if you don't need it, don't store it!_<br>**Examples**<br>An automated, programmatic procedure could be run to<br>locate and remove data, or a manual review of data<br>storage areas could be performed.

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Disk-level encryption typically encrypts the entire disk<br>or partition using the same key, with all data<br>automatically decrypted when the system runs or when<br>an authorized user requests it. Many disk-encryption<br>solutions intercept operating system read/write<br>operations and perform the appropriate cryptographic<br>transformations without any special action by the user<br>other than supplying a password or passphrase at<br>system start-up or at the beginning of a session.

No single person can<br>access or use the authentication factor (for example,<br>the password, PIN, or key) of another.<br>**Good Practice**<br>Where key components or key shares are used,<br>procedures should ensure that no single custodian ever<br>has access to sufficient key components or shares to<br>reconstruct the cryptographic key. For example, in an<br>m-of-n scheme (for example, Shamir), where only two<br>of any three components are required to reconstruct the<br>cryptographic key, a custodian must not have current or<br>prior knowledge of more than one component. If a<br>custodian was previously assigned component A, which<br>was then reassigned, the custodian should not then be<br>assigned component B or C, as this would give the<br>custodian knowledge of two components and the ability<br>to recreate the key.<br>_(continued on next page)_|

_**Requirement 4: Protect Cardholder Data with Strong Cryptography During Transmission Over Open, Public**_
_**Networks**_


**Sections**


**4.1** Processes and mechanisms for protecting cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission over open, public networks are
defined and understood.


**4.2** PAN is protected with strong cryptography during transmission


**Overview**


The use of strong cryptography provides greater assurance in preserving data confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.


To protect against compromise, PAN must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are easily accessed by malicious individuals,
including untrusted and public networks. Misconfigured wireless networks and vulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols
continue to be targeted by malicious individuals aiming to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to cardholder data environments
(CDE). Any transmissions of cardholder data over an entity’s internal network(s) will naturally bring that network into scope for PCI DSS since
that network stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data. Any such networks must be evaluated and assessed against applicable PCI DSS
requirements.


Requirement 4 applies to transmissions of PAN unless specifically called out in an individual requirement.


PAN transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is
transmitted, or both. While it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is recommended.


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of “strong cryptography” and other PCI DSS terms.

|**Applicability Notes**||Some protocol implementations (such as SSL,<br>SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known<br>vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain<br>access to the cleartext data. It is critical that<br>entities maintain awareness of industry-defined<br>deprecation dates for the cipher suites they are<br>using and are prepared to migrate to newer<br>versions or protocols when older ones are no<br>longer deemed secure.<br>Verifying that certificates are trusted helps ensure<br>the integrity of the secure connection. To be<br>considered trusted, a certificate should be issued<br>from a trusted source, such as a trusted certificate<br>authority (CA), and not be expired. Up-to-date<br>Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online<br>Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to<br>validate certificates.<br>Techniques to validate certificates may include<br>certificate and public key pinning, where the<br>trusted certificate or a public key is pinned either<br>during development or upon its first use. Entities<br>can also confirm with developers or review source<br>code to ensure that clients and servers reject<br>connections if the certificate is bad.<br>For browser-based TLS certificates, certificate<br>trust can often be verified by clicking on the lock<br>icon that appears next to the address bar.<br>_(continued on next page)_|

#### **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**

_**Requirement 5: Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software**_


**Sections**


**5.1** Processes and mechanisms for protecting all systems and networks from malicious software are defined and understood.


**5.2** Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.


**5.3** Anti-malware mechanisms and processes are active, maintained, and monitored.


**5.4** Anti-phishing mechanisms protect users against phishing attacks.


**Overview**


Malicious software (malware) is software or firmware designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's knowledge or
consent, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the owner’s data, applications, or operating system.


Examples include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, ransomware, keyloggers, rootkits, malicious code, scripts, and links.


Malware can enter the network during many business-approved activities, including employee e-mail (for example, via phishing) and use of the
Internet, mobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system vulnerabilities.


Using anti-malware solutions that address all types of malware helps to protect systems from current and evolving malware threats.


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Periodic scans can identify malware that is present,<br>but currently inactive, within the environment. Some<br>malware, such as zero-day malware, can enter an<br>environment before the scan solution is capable of<br>detecting it. Performing regular periodic scans or<br>continuous behavioral analysis of systems or<br>processes helps ensure that previously<br>undetectable malware can be identified, removed,<br>and investigated to determine how it gained access<br>to the environment.<br>**Good Practice**<br>Using a combination of periodic scans (scheduled<br>and on-demand) and active, real-time (on-access)<br>scanning helps ensure that malware residing in both<br>static and dynamic elements of the CDE is<br>addressed.

|**5.4.1**_(continued)_ <br>||**Definitions** <br>Phishing is a form of social engineering and<br>describes the different methods used by attackers to<br>trick personnel into disclosing sensitive information,<br>such as user account names and passwords, and<br>account data. Attackers will typically disguise<br>themselves and attempt to appear as a genuine or<br>trusted source, directing personnel to send an email<br>response, click on a web link, or enter data into a<br>compromised website. Mechanisms that can detect<br>and prevent phishing attempts are often included in<br>anti-malware solutions.<br>**Further Information**<br>See the following for more information about<br>phishing:<br>_National Cyber Security Centre - Phishing Attacks:_<br>_Defending your Organization_.<br>_US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency -_<br>_Report Phishing Sites._|

_**Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software**_


**Sections**


**6.1** Processes and mechanisms for developing and maintaining secure systems and software are defined and understood.


**6.2** Bespoke and custom software are developed securely.


**6.3** Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.


**6.4** Public-facing web applications are protected against attacks.


**6.5** Changes to all system components are managed securely.


**Overview**


Actors with bad intentions can use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendor
provided security patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the systems. All system components must have all appropriate
software patches to protect against the exploitation and compromise of account data by malicious individuals and malicious software.


Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated and tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflict
with existing security configurations. For bespoke and custom software, numerous vulnerabilities can be avoided by applying software lifecycle
(SLC) processes and secure coding techniques.


Code repositories that store application code, system configurations, or other configuration data that can impact the security of cardholder data
and/or sensitive authentication data are in scope for PCI DSS assessments.


See _Relationship between PCI DSS and PCI SSC Software Standards_ on page 7 for information about the use of PCI SSC-validated software
and software vendors, and how use of PCI SSC’s software standards may help with meeting controls in Requirement 6.


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of PCI DSS terms.


_**Note**_ _: Requirement 6 applies to all system components, except for section 6.2 for developing software securely, which applies only to bespoke_
_and custom software used on any system component included in or connected to the CDE._

|**Applicability Notes**||An organization’s processes for managing<br>vulnerabilities should be integrated with other<br>management processes—for example, risk<br>management, change management, patch<br>management, incident response, application security,<br>as well as proper monitoring and logging of these<br>processes. This process should include multiple<br>sources of vulnerability information, including<br>industry-recognized vulnerability databases (for<br>example, the US National Vulnerability Database),<br>CERTs, RSS feeds, information received from<br>vendors and third parties, and vulnerabilities<br>identified via internal and external vulnerability scans<br>(Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2). This will help to<br>ensure all vulnerabilities are properly identified and<br>addressed. Processes should support ongoing<br>evaluation of vulnerabilities. For example, a<br>vulnerability initially identified as low risk could<br>become a higher risk later. Additionally,<br>vulnerabilities individually considered to be low or<br>medium risk, could collectively pose a high or critical<br>risk if present on the same system, or if exploited on<br>a low-risk system that could result in access to the<br>CDE.<br>_(continued on next page)_|

#### **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**

_**Requirement 7: Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know**_


**Sections**


**7.1** Processes and mechanisms for restricting access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know are defined and
understood.


**7.2** Access to system components and data is appropriately defined and assigned.


**7.3** Access to system components and data is managed via an access control system(s).


**Overview**


Unauthorized individuals may gain access to critical data or systems due to ineffective access control rules and definitions. To ensure critical
data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, systems and processes must be in place to limit access based on need to know and
according to job responsibilities.


“Access” or “access rights” are created by rules that provide users access to systems, applications, and data, while “privileges” allow a user to
perform a specific action or function in relation to that system, application, or data. For example, a user may have access rights to specific data,
but whether they can only read that data, or can also change or delete the data is determined by the user’s assigned privileges.


“Need to know” refers to providing access to only the least amount of data needed to perform a job.


“Least privileges” refers to providing only the minimum level of privileges needed to perform a job.


These requirements apply to user accounts and access for employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors and other
third parties (for example, for providing support or maintenance services). Certain requirements also apply to application and system accounts
used by the entity (also called “service accounts”).


**These requirements do not apply to consumers (cardholders)** .


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Defining an access control model that is<br>appropriate for the entity’s technology and access<br>control philosophy supports a consistent and<br>uniform way of allocating access and reduces the<br>possibility of errors such as the granting of<br>excessive rights.<br>**Good Practice**<br>A factor to consider when defining access needs<br>is the separation of duties principle. This principle<br>is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of<br>resources. For example, 1) dividing mission-<br>critical functions and information system support<br>functions among different individuals and/or<br>functions, 2) establishing roles such that<br>information system support activities are<br>performed by different functions/individuals (for<br>example, system management, programming,<br>configuration management, quality assurance and<br>testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring<br>security personnel administering access control<br>functions do not also administer audit functions.<br>In environments where one individual performs<br>multiple functions, such as administration and<br>security operations, duties may be assigned so<br>that no single individual has end-to-end control of<br>a process without an independent checkpoint. For<br>example, responsibility for configuration and<br>responsibility for approving changes could be<br>assigned to separate individuals.<br>_(continued on next page)_|

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Assigning least privileges helps prevent users<br>without sufficient knowledge about the application<br>from incorrectly or accidentally changing<br>application configuration or altering its security<br>settings. Enforcing least privilege also helps to<br>minimize the scope of damage if an unauthorized<br>person gains access to a user ID.<br>**Good Practice**<br>Access rights are granted to a user by<br>assignment to one or several functions. Access is<br>assigned depending on the specific user functions<br>and with the minimum scope required for the job.<br>When assigning privileged access, it is important<br>to assign individuals only the privileges they need<br>to perform their job (the “least privileges”). For<br>example, the database administrator or backup<br>administrator should not be assigned the same<br>privileges as the overall systems administrator.<br>Once needs are defined for user functions (per<br>PCI DSS requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant<br>individuals access according to their job<br>classification and function by using the already-<br>created roles.<br>Entities may wish to consider use of Privileged<br>Access Management (PAM), which is a method to<br>grant access to privileged accounts only when<br>those privileges are required, immediately<br>revoking that access once they are no longer<br>needed.|

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Regular review of access rights helps to detect<br>excessive access rights remaining after user job<br>responsibilities change, system functions change,<br>or other modifications. If excessive user rights are<br>not revoked in due time, they may be used by<br>malicious users for unauthorized access.<br>This review provides another opportunity to<br>ensure that accounts for all terminated users have<br>been removed (if any were missed at the time of<br>termination), as well as to ensure that any third<br>parties that no longer need access have had their<br>access terminated.<br>**Good Practice**<br>When a user transfers into a new role or a new<br>department, typically the privileges and access<br>associated with their former role are no longer<br>required. Continued access to privileges or<br>functions that are no longer required may<br>introduce the risk of misuse or errors. Therefore,<br>when responsibilities change, processes that<br>revalidate access help to ensure user access is<br>appropriate for the user’s new responsibilities.<br>Entities can consider implementing a regular,<br>repeatable process for conducting reviews of<br>access rights, and assigning “data owners” that<br>are responsible for managing and monitoring<br>access to data related to their job function and<br>that also ensure user access remains current and<br>appropriate. As an example, a direct manager<br>could review team access monthly, while the<br>senior manager reviews their groups’ access<br>quarterly, both making updates to access as<br>needed. The intent of these best practices is to<br>support and facilitate conducting the reviews at<br>least once every 6 months.|

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>The misuse of query access to repositories of<br>cardholder data has been a regular cause of data<br>breaches. Limiting such access to administrators<br>reduces the risk of such access being abused by<br>unauthorized users.<br>**Definitions**<br>“Programmatic methods” means granting access<br>through means such as database stored<br>procedures that allow users to perform controlled<br>actions to data in a table, rather than via direct,<br>unfiltered access to the data repository by end<br>users (except for the responsible administrator(s),<br>who need direct access to the database for their<br>administrative duties).<br>**Good Practice**<br>Typical user actions include moving, copying, and<br>deleting data. Also consider the scope of privilege<br>needed when granting access. For example,<br>access can be granted to specific objects such as<br>data elements, files, tables, indexes, views, and<br>stored routines.

_**Requirement 8: Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components**_


**Sections**


**8.1** Processes and mechanisms for identifying users and authenticating access to system components are defined and understood.


**8.2** User identification and related accounts for users and administrators are strictly managed throughout an account’s lifecycle.


**8.3** Strong authentication for users and administrators is established and managed.


**8.4** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented to secure access into the CDE.


**8.5** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems are configured to prevent misuse.


**8.6** Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.


**Overview**


Two fundamental principles of identifying and authenticating users are to 1) establish the identity of an individual or process on a computer
system, and 2) prove or verify the user associated with the identity is who the user claims to be.


Identification of an individual or process on a computer system is conducted by associating an identity with a person or process through an
identifier, such as a user, system, or application ID. These IDs (also referred to as “accounts”) fundamentally establish the identity of an individual
or process by assigning unique identification to each person or process to distinguish one user or process from another. When each user or
process can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in place,
actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes.


The element used to prove or verify the identity is known as the authentication factor. Authentication factors are 1) something you know, such as
a password or passphrase, 2) something you have, such as a token device or smart card, or 3) something you are, such as a biometric element.


The ID and the authentication factor together are considered authentication credentials and are used to gain access to the rights and privileges
associated with a user, application, system, or service accounts.


These requirements for identity and authentication are based on industry-accepted security principles and best practices to support the payment
ecosystem. _NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines_ provides additional information on acceptable frameworks for digital
identity and authentication factors. It is important to note that the _NIST Digital Identity Guidelines_ is intended for US Federal Agencies and should
be viewed in its entirety. Many of the concepts and approaches defined in these guidelines are expected to work with each other and not as
standalone parameters.

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Strong passwords/passphrases may be the first<br>line of defense into a network since a malicious<br>individual will often first try to find accounts with<br>weak, static, or non-existent passwords.

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Access to in-scope system components that are<br>not in the CDE may be provided using a single<br>authentication factor, such as a<br>password/passphrase, token device or smart<br>card, or biometric attribute. Where<br>passwords/passphrases are employed as the only<br>authentication factor for such access, additional<br>controls are required to protect the integrity of the<br>password/passphrase.<br>**Good Practice**<br>Passwords/passphrases that are valid for a long<br>time without a change provide malicious<br>individuals with more time to break the<br>password/phrase.

_**Requirement 9: Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data**_


**Sections**


**9.1** Processes and mechanisms for restricting physical access to cardholder data are defined and understood.


**9.2** Physical access controls manage entry into facilities and systems containing cardholder data.


**9.3** Physical access for personnel and visitors is authorized and managed.


**9.4** Media with cardholder data is securely stored, accessed, distributed, and destroyed.


**9.5** Point of interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.


**Overview**


Any physical access to cardholder data or systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data provides the opportunity for individuals to
access and/or remove systems or hardcopies containing cardholder data; therefore, physical access should be appropriately restricted.


There are three different areas mentioned in Requirement 9:


1. Requirements that specifically refer to sensitive areas are intended to apply to those areas only. Each entity should identify the sensitive
areas in its environments to ensure the appropriate physical controls are implemented.


2. Requirements that specifically refer to the cardholder data environment (CDE) are intended to apply to the entire CDE, including any
sensitive areas residing within the CDE.


3. Requirements that specifically refer to the facility are referencing the types of controls that may be managed more broadly at the
physical boundary of a business premise (such as a building) within which CDEs and sensitive areas reside. These controls often exist
outside a CDE or sensitive area, for example a guard desk that identifies, badges, and logs visitors. The term “facility” is used to
recognize that these controls may exist at different places within a facility, for instance, at building entry or at an internal entrance to a
data center or office space.


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of “media,” “personnel,” “sensitive areas,” “visitors,” and other PCI DSS terms.

_**Requirement 10: Log and Monitor All Access to System Components and Cardholder Data**_


**Sections**


**10.1** Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and
understood.


**10.2** Audit logs are implemented to support the detection of anomalies and suspicious activity, and the forensic analysis of events.


**10.3** Audit logs are protected from destruction and unauthorized modifications.


**10.4** Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.


**10.5** Audit log history is retained and available for analysis.


**10.6** Time-synchronization mechanisms support consistent time settings across all systems.


**10.7** Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.


**Overview**


Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise.
The presence of logs on all system components and in the cardholder data environment (CDE) allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis
when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise is difficult, if not impossible, without system activity logs.


This requirement applies to user activities, including those by employees, contractors, consultants, and internal and external vendors, and other
third parties (for example, those providing support or maintenance services).


These requirements do not apply to user activity of consumers (cardholders).


Refer to _Appendix G_ for definitions of PCI DSS terms.

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose** <br>Often a malicious individual who has entered the<br>network will try to edit the audit logs to hide their<br>activity. Without adequate protection of audit logs,<br>their completeness, accuracy, and integrity<br>cannot be guaranteed, and the audit logs can be<br>rendered useless as an investigation tool after a<br>compromise. Therefore, audit logs should be<br>protected on the originating systems as well as<br>anywhere else they are stored.<br>**Good Practice**<br>Entities should attempt to prevent logs from being<br>exposed in public-accessible locations.|

|**Customized Approach Objective**||Scanning for vulnerabilities alone is not a<br>penetration test, nor is a penetration test<br>adequate if the focus is solely on trying to exploit<br>vulnerabilities found in a vulnerability scan.<br>Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the<br>first steps, but it is not the only step a penetration<br>tester will perform to plan the testing strategy.<br>Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known<br>vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often<br>gain enough knowledge about the system to<br>identify possible security gaps.<br>Penetration testing is a highly manual process.<br>While some automated tools may be used, the<br>tester uses their knowledge of systems to gain<br>access into an environment. Often the tester will<br>chain several types of exploits together with the<br>goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For<br>example, if the tester finds a way to gain access<br>to an application server, the tester will then use<br>the compromised server as a point to stage a new<br>attack based on the resources to which the server<br>has access. In this way, a tester can simulate the<br>techniques used by an attacker to identify areas<br>of potential weakness in the environment. The<br>testing of security monitoring and detection<br>methods—for example, to confirm the<br>effectiveness of logging and file integrity<br>monitoring mechanisms, should also be<br>considered.<br>_(continued on next page)_|

#### **Maintain an Information Security Policy**

_**Requirement 12: Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs**_


**Sections**


**12.1** A comprehensive information security policy that governs and provides direction for protection of the entity’s information assets is known
and current.


**12.2** Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.


**12.3** Risks to the cardholder data environment are formally identified, evaluated, and managed.


**12.4** PCI DSS compliance is managed.


**12.5** PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.


**12.6** Security awareness education is an ongoing activity.


**12.7** Personnel are screened to reduce risks from insider threats.


**12.8** Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.


**12.9** Third-party service providers (TPSPs) support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance.


**12.10** Suspected and confirmed security incidents that could impact the CDE are responded to immediately.


**Overview**


The organization’s overall information security policy sets the tone for the whole entity and informs personnel what is expected of them. All
personnel should be aware of the sensitivity of cardholder data and their responsibilities for protecting it.


For the purposes of Requirement 12, “personnel” refers to full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees, contractors, and
consultants with security responsibilities for protecting account data or that can impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive
authentication data.

Examples of factors that could<br>contribute to likelihood or impact include any that<br>could increase the vulnerability of an asset to a<br>threat—for example, exposure to untrusted<br>networks, complexity of environment, or high staff<br>turnover—as well as the criticality of the system<br>components, or volume and sensitivity of the<br>data, being protected.<br>_(continued on next page)_|

|**Defined Approach Requirements**|**Defined Approach Testing Procedures**|**Purpose**<br>Protocols and encryption strengths may quickly<br>change or be deprecated due to identification of<br>vulnerabilities or design flaws. In order to support<br>current and future data security needs, entities<br>need to know where cryptography is used and<br>understand how they would be able to respond<br>rapidly to changes impacting the strength of their<br>cryptographic implementations.**Good Practice**<br>Cryptographic agility is important to ensure an<br>alternative to the original encryption method or<br>cryptographic primitive is available, with plans to<br>upgrade to the alternative without significant<br>change to system infrastructure.

|**Customized Approach Objective**||In addition to internal systems and networks, all<br>connections from third-party entities—for<br>example, business partners, entities providing<br>remote support services, and other service<br>providers—need to be identified to determine<br>inclusion for PCI DSS scope. Once the in-scope<br>connections have been identified, the applicable<br>PCI DSS controls can be implemented to reduce<br>the risk of a third-party connection being used to<br>compromise an entity’s CDE.<br>A data discovery tool or methodology can be used<br>to facilitate identifying all sources and locations of<br>PAN, and to look for PAN that resides on systems<br>and networks outside the currently defined CDE<br>or in unexpected places within the defined CDE—<br>for example, in an error log or memory dump file.<br>This approach can help ensure that previously<br>unknown locations of PAN are detected and that<br>the PAN is either eliminated or properly secured.<br>**Further Information**<br>For additional guidance, refer to_Information_<br>_Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and_<br>_Network Segmentation_.|

_**Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities Using SSL/Early TLS for Card-Present POS POI**_
_**Terminal Connections**_


**Sections**


**A2.1** POI terminals using SSL and/or early TLS are confirmed as not susceptible to known SSL/TLS exploits.


**Overview**


This Appendix applies only to entities using SSL/early TLS as a security control to protect POS POI terminals, including service providers that
provide connections into POS POI terminals.


Entities using SSL and early TLS for POS POI terminal connections must work toward upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon as
possible. Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where those protocols don’t already exist. At the time of
publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment terminals. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any
time, and it is up to the organization to remain up to date with vulnerability trends and determine whether it is susceptible to any known exploits.


The PCI DSS requirements directly affected are:


 - **Requirement 2.2.5** : Where any insecure services, protocols, or daemons are present; business justification is documented, and additional
security features are documented and implemented that reduce the risk of using insecure services, protocols, or daemons.


 - **Requirement 2.2.7** : All non-console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography.


 - **Requirement 4.2.1** : Strong cryptography and security protocols are implemented to safeguard PAN during transmission over open, public
networks.


SSL and early TLS must not be used as a security control to meet these requirements, except in the case of POS POI terminal connections, as
detailed in this appendix. To support entities working to migrate from SSL/early TLS on POS POI terminals, the following provisions are
included:


 - New POS POI terminal implementations must not use SSL or early TLS as a security control.


 - All POS POI terminal service providers must provide a secure service offering.


 - Service providers supporting existing POS POI terminal implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation
and Migration Plan in place.


 - POS POI terminals in card-present environments that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS,
**and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect**, may continue using SSL/early TLS as a security control.


Requirements in this Appendix are not eligible for the Customized Approach.

_**Appendix A3: Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV)**_


**Sections**


**A3.1** A PCI DSS compliance program is implemented.


**A3.2** PCI DSS scope is documented and validated.


**A3.3** PCI DSS is incorporated into business-as-usual (BAU) activities.


**A3.4** Logical access to the cardholder data environment is controlled and managed.


**A3.5** Suspicious events are identified and responded to.


**Overview**


This Appendix applies only to entities designated by a payment brand(s) or acquirer as requiring additional validation of existing PCI DSS
requirements. An entity is required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix ONLY if instructed to do so by an acquirer or a
payment brand. Examples of entities that this Appendix could apply to include:


 - Those storing, processing, and/or transmitting large volumes of account data,


 - Those providing aggregation points for account data, or


 - Those that have suffered significant or repeated breaches of account data.


Additionally, other PCI standards may reference completion of this Appendix.


These supplemental validation steps are intended to provide greater assurance that PCI DSS controls are maintained effectively and on a
continuous basis through validation of business-as-usual (BAU) processes and increased validation and scoping consideration.

_(continued)_


_**Note**_ _: Some PCI DSS requirements in this Appendix have defined timeframes (for example, an activity that is to be performed at least once_
_every three months or six months). For an initial assessment to such requirements, it is not required that an activity has been performed for_
_every such timeframe during the previous year, if the assessor verifies:_


 - _The activity was performed in accordance with the applicable requirement within the most recent timeframe (for example, the most recent_
_three-month or six-month period), and_


 - _The entity has documented policies and procedures for continuing to perform the activity within the defined timeframe._


_For subsequent years after the initial assessment, an activity must have been performed within each required timeframe. For example, an_
_activity required at least every three months must have been performed at least four times during the previous year at an interval that does not_
_exceed 90-92 days._


_Refer to section 7_ Descriptions of Timeframes Used in PCI DSS Requirements _for additional guidance about initial assessments._


Not all requirements in PCI DSS apply to all entities that may undergo a PCI DSS assessment. It is for this reason that some PCI DSS
Requirements are duplicated in this appendix. Any questions about this appendix should be addressed to acquirers or payment brands.

|Defined Approach Requirements|Defined Approach Testing Procedures|Purpose<br>The ability to identify attack patterns and<br>undesirable behavior across systems—for<br>example, using centrally managed or automated<br>log-correlation tools— is critical in preventing,<br>detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data<br>compromise. The presence of logs in all<br>environments allows thorough tracking, alerting,<br>and analysis when something goes wrong.<br>Determining the cause of a compromise is very<br>difficult, if not impossible, without a process to<br>corroborate information from critical system<br>components and systems that perform security<br>functions, such as network security controls,<br>IDS/IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM)<br>systems. Thus, logs for all critical system<br>components and systems that perform security<br>functions need to be collected, correlated, and<br>maintained.

### **Appendix B Compensating Controls**

Compensating controls may be considered when an entity cannot meet a PCI DSS requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate and
documented technical or business constraints but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with not meeting the requirement through
implementation of other, or compensating, controls.


Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:


1. Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.


2. Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk
that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. To understand the intent of a requirement, see _the Customized_
_Approach Objective_ for most PCI DSS requirements. If a requirement is not eligible for the Customized Approach and therefore does not
have a Customized Approach Objective, refer to the **Purpose** in the Guidance column for that requirement.


3. Be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a
compensating control.)


4. When evaluating “above and beyond” for compensating controls, consider the following:


a) Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under



review. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent
encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting cleartext administrative passwords. An entity
cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex passwords,
etc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password
requirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of cleartext passwords. Also, the other
password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review
(passwords).


b) Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are
required for another area but are not required for the item under review.


c) Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a
compensating control. For example, if a company is unable to address a vulnerability that
is exploitable through a network interface because a security update is not yet available
from a vendor, a compensating control could consist of controls that include all of the
following: 1) internal network segmentation, 2) limiting network access to the vulnerable
interface to only required devices (IP address or MAC address filtering), and 3) IDS/IPS
monitoring of all traffic destined to the vulnerable interface.

_© 2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved._ _Page 369_


5. Address the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement.


6. Address the requirement currently and in the future. A compensating control cannot address a requirement that was missed in the past
(for example, where performance of a task was required two quarters ago, but that task was not performed).


The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to confirm that each
compensating control adequately addresses the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-6 above.


To maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is
complete. Additionally, compensating control results must be documented in the applicable report for the assessment (for example, a Report
on Compliance or a Self-Assessment Questionnaire) in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section, and included when the applicable
report is submitted to the requesting organization.

### **Appendix C Compensating Controls Worksheet**

The entity must use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement where compensating controls are used to meet a PCI
DSS requirement. Note that compensating controls should also be documented in accordance with instructions in the Report on Compliance in
the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.


_**Note:**_ _Only entities that have legitimate and documented technological or business constraints can consider the use of compensating controls_
_to achieve compliance._


**Requirement Number and Definition:**

|Col1|Information Required|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Constraints**|Document the legitimate technical or business<br>constraints precluding compliance with the<br>original requirement.||
|**2. Definition of Compensating Controls**|Define the compensating controls: explain how<br>they address the objectives of the original<br>control and the increased risk, if any.||
|**3. Objective**|Define the objective of the original control (for<br>example, the Customized Approach Objective).||
|**3. Objective**|Identify the objective met by the compensating<br>control_(note: this can be, but is not required to_<br>_be, the stated Customized Approach Objective_<br>_for the PCI DSS requirement)._||
|**4. Identified Risk**|Identify any additional risk posed by the lack of<br>the original control.||
|**5. Validation of Compensating Controls**|Define how the compensating controls were<br>validated and tested.||
|**6. Maintenance**|Define process(es) and controls in place to<br>maintain compensating controls.||

### **Appendix D Customized Approach**

This approach is intended for entities that decide to meet a PCI DSS requirement’s stated Customized Approach Objective in a way that does
not strictly follow the defined requirement. The customized approach allows an entity to take a strategic approach to meeting a requirement’s
Customized Approach Objective, so it can determine and design the security controls needed to meet the objective in a manner unique for that
organization.


**The entity** implementing a customized approach must satisfy the following criteria:


   - Document and maintain evidence about each customized control, including all information specified in the Controls Matrix Template in
_PCI DSS v4.x: Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach_ on the PCI SSC website


   - Perform and document a targeted risk analysis (PCI DSS Requirement 12.3.2) for each customized control, including all information
specified in the Targeted Risk Analysis Template in _PCI DSS v4.x: Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach_ on the PCI
SSC website.


   - Perform testing of each customized control to prove effectiveness, and document testing performed, methods used, what was tested,
when testing was performed, and results of testing in the controls matrix.


   - Monitor and maintain evidence about the effectiveness of each customized control.


   - Provide completed controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, testing evidence, and evidence of customized control effectiveness to its

assessor.


**The assessor** performing an assessment of customized controls must satisfy the following criteria:


   - Review the entity’s controls matrix(es), targeted risk analysis, and evidence of control effectiveness to fully understand the customized
control(s) and to verify the entity meets all Customized Approach documentation and evidence requirements.


   - Derive and document the appropriate testing procedures needed to conduct thorough testing of each customized control.


   - Test each customized control to determine whether the entity’s implementation 1) meets the requirement’s Customized Approach
Objective and 2) results in an “in place” finding for the requirement.


   - At all times, QSAs maintain independence requirements defined in the QSA Qualification Requirements. This means if a QSA is
involved in designing or implementing a customized control, that QSA does not also derive testing procedures for, assess, or assist with
the assessment of that customized control.


The entity and its assessor are expected to work together to ensure 1) they agree that the customized control(s) fully meets the customized
approach objective, 2) the assessor fully understands the customized control, and 3) the entity understands the derived testing the assessor
will perform.


_Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard: Requirements and Testing Procedures, v4.0.1_ _June 2024_
_© 2006 - 2024 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC. All rights reserved._ _Page 372_


Use of the customized approach must be documented by a QSA or ISA in accordance with instructions in the Report on Compliance (ROC)
Template and following the instructions in the _FAQs for use with PCI DSS v4.x ROC Template_ available on the PCI SSC website.


Entities that complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire are not eligible to use a customized approach; however, these entities may elect to
have a QSA or ISA perform their assessment and document it in a ROC Template.


The use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and
acquirers). Therefore, questions about use of a customized approach must be referred to those organizations, including, for example, whether
an entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA to complete an assessment using the customized approach.


_**Note:**_ _Compensating controls are not an option with the customized approach. Because the customized approach allows an entity to_
_determine and design the controls needed to meet a requirement’s Customized Approach Objective, the entity is expected to effectively_
_implement the controls it designed for that requirement without needing to also implement alternate, compensating controls._

### **Appendix E Sample Templates to Support Customized Approach**

Sample templates to support the Customized Approach (the _Sample Controls Matrix Template_ and _Sample Targeted Risk Analysis Template_ )
provide examples of formats that could be used by entities when documenting their Customized Approach. _While it is not required that entities_
_follow the specific formats provided in these sample templates, the entity’s control matrix and targeted risk analysis must include all the_
_information as defined in these templates._


These sample templates are available on the PCI SSC website.

### **Appendix F Leveraging the PCI Software Security Framework to Support** **Requirement 6**

PCI DSS Requirement 6 defines requirements for the development and maintenance of secure systems and software. Because the PCI SSC
Secure Software Standard and the Secure SLC Standard (collectively, the Software Security Framework) include rigorous software security
requirements, the use of bespoke and custom software that is developed and maintained in accordance with either standard can help the
entity to meet several requirements in PCI DSS Requirement 6 without having to perform additional detailed testing, and may also support use
of the Customized Approach for other requirements. For details, see Table 7.


_**Note**_ _: This support for meeting Requirement 6 applies only to software that is specifically developed and maintained in accordance with the_
_Secure Software Standard or the Secure SLC Standard; it does not extend to other software or system components in scope for_
_Requirement 6._

_**Use of Bespoke and Custom Software Developed and Maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor**_


When validating the use of software developed and maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor to meet PCI DSS Requirement 6.2 and
support the Customized Approach for Requirements 6.3 and 6.5, the assessor must confirm that the following is met:


   - The software vendor has a current listing on the PCI SSC List of Secure SLC Qualified Vendors—that is, the validation has not expired.


   - The software was developed and is being maintained using software lifecycle management practices that were assessed as part of the
software vendor’s validation.


   - The entity is following the implementation guidance provided by the Secure SLC Qualified Vendor.


_**Use of Bespoke and Custom Software Developed in Accordance with the Secure SLC Standard**_


Entities that internally develop software solely for their use or that develop software for use by a single entity may choose to engage a Secure
SLC Assessor to assess their software lifecycle management practices against the Secure SLC Standard. The Secure SLC Assessor will
document the results of the assessment in a Secure SLC Report on Compliance (ROC) and a Secure SLC Attestation of Compliance (AOC).


Software that is developed and maintained following software lifecycle management practices provides the same support for PCI DSS
Requirement 6 as software developed and maintained by a Secure SLC Qualified Vendor, if those practices were assessed by a Secure SLC
Assessor and confirmed to meet the Secure SLC Standard requirements, with the results documented in a Secure SLC ROC and AOC.


_**Validating the Use of the Secure SLC Standard**_


When validating the use of software developed and maintained in accordance with the Secure SLC Standard to meet PCI DSS Requirement
6.2 and support customized approach for Requirements 6.3 and 6.5, the assessor must confirm that the following are met:


   - The software lifecycle management practices were assessed by a Secure SLC Assessor and confirmed to meet all Secure SLC
Standard requirements with the results documented in a Secure SLC Report on Compliance (ROC) and Secure SLC Attestation of
Compliance (AOC).


   - The software was developed and maintained using the software lifecycle management practices covered by the Secure SLC

assessment.


   - A full Secure SLC assessment of the software lifecycle management practices was completed within the previous 36 months.
Additionally, if the most recent full Secure SLC assessment occurred more than 12 months ago, an Annual Attestation was provided by
the developer/vendor within the previous 12 months that confirms continued adherence to Secure SLC Standard for the software
lifecycle management practices in use.

Requirement 6.2.4 and support customized approach for Requirements 6.3 and 6.5, the assessor must confirm that the following are met:


   - The secure software assessment was conducted by a Secure Software Assessor and confirmed to meet all requirements in the Secure
Software Standard with the results documented in a Secure Software Report on Validation (ROV) and Secure Software Attestation of
Validation (AOV).


   - The software was developed and is being maintained using the software lifecycle management practices that were covered by the
Secure Software assessment.


   - A full Secure Software assessment was completed within the previous 36 months. Additionally, if the most recent full Secure Software
assessment occurred more than 12 months ago, an Annual Attestation was provided by the developer/vendor within the previous 12
