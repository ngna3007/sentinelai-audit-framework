Customized Approach Objective:
Expectations, controls, and oversight for meeting activities within Requirement 1 are defined, understood, and adhered to by affected personnel. All supporting activities are repeatable, consistently applied, and conform to management’s intent.

Guidance:
Purpose: Requirement 1.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout requirement 1. while it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in requirement 1, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated. Good Practice: It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. for these reasons, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle. Definitions: Security policies define the entity’s security objectives and principles. operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.","{""control_id"": ""1.1.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": false, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Testing Procedure 1.2.5.b: Examine configuration settings for NSCs to verify that only approved services, protocols, and ports are in use.

Guidance:
Purpose: Compromises often happen due to unused or insecure services (for example, telnet and ftp), protocols, and ports, since these can lead to unnecessary points of access being opened into the cde. additionally, services, protocols, and ports that are enabled but not in use are often overlooked and left unsecured and unpatched. by identifying the services, protocols, and ports necessary for business, entities can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed. Good Practice: The security risk associated with each service, protocol, and port allowed should be understood. approvals should be granted by personnel independent of those managing the configuration. approving personnel should possess knowledge and accountability appropriate for making approval decisions.","{""control_id"": ""1.2.5"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Compromises take advantage of insecure network configurations. Good Practice: If insecure services, protocols, or ports are necessary for business, the risk posed by these services, protocols, and ports should be clearly understood and accepted by the organization, the use of the service, protocol, or port should be justified, and the security features that mitigate the risk of using these services, protocols, and ports should be defined and implemented by the entity.

Testing Procedure 1.2.7.c: Examine configurations for NSCs to verify that configurations identified as no longer being supported by a business justification are removed or updated.

Guidance:
Purpose: Such a review gives the organization an opportunity to clean up any unneeded, outdated, or incorrect rules and configurations which could be utilized by an unauthorized person. furthermore, it ensures that all rules and configurations allow only authorized services, protocols, and ports that match the documented business justifications. Good Practice: This review, which can be implemented using manual, automated, or system-based methods, is intended to confirm that the settings that manage traffic rules, what is allowed in and out of the network, match the approved configurations. the review should provide confirmation that all permitted access has a justified business reason. any discrepancies or uncertainties about a rule or configuration should be escalated for resolution. while this requirement specifies that this review occur at least once every six months, organizations with a high volume of changes to their network configurations may wish to consider performing reviews more frequently to ensure that the configurations continue to meet the needs of the business.","{""control_id"": ""1.2.7"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 1.2.8: Examine configuration files for NSCs to verify they are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: To prevent unauthorized configurations from being applied to the network, stored files with configurations for network controls need to be kept up to date and secured against unauthorized changes. keeping configuration information current and secure ensures that the correct settings for nscs are applied whenever the configuration is run.

Guidance:
Purpose: Implementing nscs at every connection coming into and out of trusted networks allows the entity to monitor and control access and minimizes the chances of a malicious individual obtaining access to the internal network via an unprotected connection. Examples: An entity could implement a dmz, which is a part of the network that manages connections between an untrusted network (for examples of untrusted networks refer to the requirement 1 overview) and services that an organization needs to have available to the public, such as a web server. please note that if an entity’s dmz processes or transmits account data (for example, e-commerce website), it is also considered a cde.","{""control_id"": ""1.4.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Defined Approach Requirements:
Inbound traffic from untrusted networks to trusted networks is restricted to: Communications with system components that are authorized to provide publicly accessible services, protocols, and ports. Stateful responses to communications initiated by system components in a trusted network. All other traffic is denied.

Customized Approach Objective:
Only traffic that is authorized or that is a response to a system component in the trusted network can enter a trusted network from an untrusted network.

Applicability Notes:
The intent of this requirement is to address communication sessions between trusted and untrusted networks, rather than the specifics of protocols. This requirement does not limit the use of UDP or other connectionless network protocols if state is maintained by the NSC.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 1.4.2: Examine vendor documentation and configurations of NSCs to verify that inbound traffic from untrusted networks to trusted networks is restricted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Ensuring that public access to a system component is specifically authorized reduces the risk of system components being unnecessarily exposed to untrusted networks. Good Practice: System components that provide publicly accessible services, such as email, web, and dns servers, are the most vulnerable to threats originating from untrusted networks. ideally, such systems are placed within a dedicated trusted network that is public facing (for example, a dmz) but that is separated via nscs from more sensitive internal systems, which helps protect the rest of the network in the event these externally accessible systems are compromised. this functionality is intended to prevent malicious actors from accessing the organization's internal network from the internet, or from using services, protocols, or ports in an unauthorized manner. where this functionality is provided as a built-in feature of an nsc, the entity should ensure that its configurations do not result in the functionality being disabled or bypassed. Definitions: Maintaining the ""state"" (or status) for each connection into a network means the nsc “knows” whether an apparent response to a previous connection is a valid, authorized response (since the nsc retains each connection’s status) or whether it is malicious traffic trying to fool the nsc into allowing the connection.","{""control_id"": ""1.4.2"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 1.4.3: Examine vendor documentation and configurations for NSCs to verify that anti-spoofing measures are implemented to detect and block forged source IP addresses from entering the trusted network.

Guidance:
Purpose: Filtering packets coming into the trusted network helps to, among other things, ensure packets are not “spoofed” to appear as if they are coming from an organization’s own internal network. for example, anti-spoofing measures prevent internal addresses originating from the internet from passing into the dmz. Examples: Normally, a packet contains the ip address of the computer that originally sent it so other computers in the network know where the packet originated. malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending ip address to fool the target system into believing the packet is from a trusted source. Good Practice: Products usually come with anti-spoofing set as a default and may not be configurable. entities should consult the vendor's documentation for more information.","{""control_id"": ""1.4.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Defined Approach Requirements:
System components that store cardholder data are not directly accessible from untrusted networks.

Customized Approach Objective:
Stored cardholder data cannot be accessed from untrusted networks.

Applicability Notes:
This requirement is not intended to apply to storage of account data in volatile memory but does apply where memory is being treated as persistent storage (for example, RAM disk). Account data can only be stored in volatile memory during the time necessary to support the associated business process (for example, until completion of the related payment card transaction).

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 1.4.4.a: Examine the data-flow diagram and network diagram to verify that it is documented that system components storing cardholder data are not directly accessible from the untrusted networks.
Testing Procedure 1.4.4.b: Examine configurations of NSCs to verify that controls are implemented such that system components storing cardholder data are not directly accessible from untrusted networks.

Guidance:
Purpose: Cardholder data that is directly accessible from an untrusted network, for example, because it is stored on a system within the dmz or in a cloud database service, is easier for an external attacker to access because there are fewer defensive layers to penetrate. using nscs to ensure that system components that store cardholder data (such as a database or a file) can only be directly accessed from trusted networks can prevent unauthorized network traffic from reaching the system component.","{""control_id"": ""1.4.4"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Testing Procedure 1.4.5.b: Interview personnel and examine documentation to verify that controls are implemented such that any disclosure of internal IP addresses and routing information is limited to only authorized parties.

Guidance:
Purpose: Restricting the disclosure of internal, private, and local ip addresses is useful to prevent a hacker from obtaining knowledge of these ip addresses and using that information to access the network. Examples: Methods to obscure ip addressing may include, but are not limited to: ipv4 network address translation (nat). placing system components behind proxy servers/nscs. removal or filtering of route advertisements for internal networks that use registered addressing. internal use of rfc 1918 (ipv4) or use ipv6 privacy extension (rfc 4941) when initiating outgoing sessions to the internet. Good Practice: Methods used to meet the intent of this requirement may vary, depending on the specific networking technology being used. for example, the controls used to meet this requirement may be different for ipv4 networks than for ipv6 networks.","{""control_id"": ""1.4.5"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Defined Approach Requirements:
Security controls are implemented on any computing devices, including company- and employee-owned devices, that connect to both untrusted networks (including the Internet) and the CDE as follows: Specific configuration settings are defined to prevent threats being introduced into the entity’s network. Security controls are actively running. Security controls are not alterable by users of the computing devices unless specifically documented and authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited period.

Customized Approach Objective:
Devices that connect to untrusted environments and also connect to the CDE cannot introduce threats to the entity’s CDE.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 1.5.1.a: Examine policies and configuration standards and interview personnel to verify security controls for computing devices that connect to both untrusted networks, and the CDE, are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 1.5.1.b: Examine configuration settings on computing devices that connect to both untrusted networks and the CDE to verify settings are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Computing devices that are allowed to connect to the internet from outside the corporate environment—for example, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile computing devices used by employees—are more vulnerable to internet-based threats. use of security controls such as host-based controls (for example, personal firewall software or end-point protection solutions), network-based security controls (for example, firewalls, network- based heuristics inspection, and malware simulation), or hardware, helps to protect devices from internet-based attacks, which could use the device to gain access to the organization’s systems and data when the device reconnects to the network. _(continued on next page)_. Examples: Practices include forbidding split-tunneling of vpns for employee-owned or corporate-owned mobile devices and requiring that such devices boot up into a vpn. Good Practice: The specific configuration settings are determined by the entity and should be consistent with its network security policies and procedures. where there is a legitimate need to temporarily disable security controls on a company-owned or employee-owned device that connects to both an untrusted network and the cde—for example, to support a specific maintenance activity or investigation of a technical problem—the reason for taking such action is understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. any disabling or altering of these security controls, including on administrators’ own devices, is performed by authorized personnel. it is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable security controls on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such controls are disabled and follow up that occurs to ensure processes were followed.","{""control_id"": ""1.5.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""network_security"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""1""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: If exceptions and anomalies identified during the log-review process are not investigated, the entity may be unaware of unauthorized and potentially malicious activities occurring within their network. Good Practice: Entities should consider how to address the following when developing their processes for defining and managing exceptions and anomalies: how log review activities are recorded, how to rank and prioritize exceptions and anomalies, what procedures should be in place to report and escalate exceptions and anomalies, and who is responsible for investigating and for any remediation tasks.","{""control_id"": ""10.4.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""logging_monitoring"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""10""}"

Defined Approach Requirements:
Audit logs are reviewed to identify anomalies or suspicious activity.

Guidance:
Purpose: Many breaches occur months before being detected. regular log reviews mean incidents can be quickly identified and proactively addressed. Good Practice: Checking logs daily (7 days a week, 365 days a year, including holidays) minimizes the amount of time and exposure of a potential breach. log harvesting, parsing, and alerting tools, centralized log management systems, event log analyzers, and security information and event management (siem) solutions are examples of automated tools that can be used to meet this requirement. daily review of security events—for example, notifications or alerts that identify suspicious or anomalous activities—as well as logs from critical system components, and logs from systems that perform security functions, such as firewalls, ids/ips, file integrity monitoring (fim) systems, etc., is necessary to identify potential issues. the determination of “security event” will vary for each organization and may include consideration for the type of technology, location, and function of the device. organizations may also wish to maintain a baseline of “normal” traffic to help identify anomalous behavior. an entity that uses third-party service providers to perform log review services is responsible to provide context about the entity’s environment to the service providers, so it understands the entity’s environment, has a baseline of “normal” traffic for the entity, and can detect potential security issues and provide accurate exceptions and anomaly notifications.","{""control_id"": ""10.4"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""logging_monitoring"", ""has_testing_procedures"": false, ""requirements_id"": ""10""}"

Defined Approach Requirements:
Internal vulnerability scans are performed via authenticated scanning as follows: Systems that are unable to accept credentials for authenticated scanning are documented. Sufficient privileges are used for those systems that accept credentials for scanning. If accounts used for authenticated scanning can be used for interactive login, they are managed in accordance with Requirement 8.2.2.

Customized Approach Objective:
Automated tools used to detect vulnerabilities can detect vulnerabilities local to each system, which are not visible remotely.

Applicability Notes:
The authenticated scanning tools can be either host-based or network-based. “Sufficient” privileges are those needed to access system resources such that a thorough scan can be conducted that detects known vulnerabilities. This requirement does not apply to system components that cannot accept credentials for scanning. Examples of systems that may not accept credentials for scanning include some network and security appliances, mainframes, and containers. _This requirement is a best practice until 31 March_ _2025, after which it will be required and must be_ _fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment._

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 11.3.1.2.a: Examine scan tool configurations to verify that authenticated scanning is used for internal scans, with sufficient privileges, for those systems that accept credentials for scanning.

Testing Procedure 11.3.1.2.d: Examine documentation to verify that systems that are unable to accept credentials for authenticated scanning are defined.

Guidance:
Purpose: Authenticated scanning provides greater insight into an entity’s vulnerability landscape since it can detect vulnerabilities that unauthenticated scans cannot detect. attackers may leverage vulnerabilities that an entity is unaware of because certain vulnerabilities will only be detected with authenticated scanning. authenticated scanning can yield significant additional information about an organization’s vulnerabilities. Good Practice: The credentials used for these scans should be considered highly privileged. they should be protected and controlled as such, following pci dss requirements 7 and 8 (except for those requirements for multi-factor authentication and application and system accounts).","{""control_id"": ""11.3.1.2"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""security_testing"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""11""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Attackers routinely look for unpatched or vulnerable externally facing servers, which can be leveraged to launch a directed attack. organizations must ensure these externally facing devices are regularly scanned for weaknesses and that vulnerabilities are patched or remediated to protect the entity. because external networks are at greater risk of compromise, external vulnerability scanning must be performed at least once every three months by a pci ssc approved scanning vendor (asv). Good Practice: While scans are required at least once every three months, more frequent scans are recommended depending on the network complexity, frequency of change, and types of devices, software, and operating systems used. vulnerabilities identified during external vulnerability scans should be part of a vulnerability management process that includes multiple vulnerability sources, as specified in requirement 6.3.1. multiple scan reports can be combined to show that all systems were scanned and that all applicable vulnerabilities were resolved as part of the three-month vulnerability scan cycle. however, additional documentation may be required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being resolved.

Applicability Notes:
Testing from inside the network (or “internal penetration testing”) means testing from both inside the CDE and into the CDE from trusted and untrusted internal networks. Testing from outside the network (or “external penetration testing”) means testing the exposed external perimeter of trusted networks, and critical systems connected to or accessible to public network infrastructures.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 11.4.1: Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify that the penetration-testing methodology defined, documented, and implemented by the entity includes all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Internal penetration testing serves two purposes. firstly, just like an external penetration test, it discovers vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be used by an attacker that had managed to get some degree of access to the internal network, whether that is because the attacker is an authorized user conducting unauthorized activities, or an external attacker that had managed to penetrate the entity’s perimeter. secondly, internal penetration testing also helps entities to discover where their change control process failed by detecting previously unknown systems. additionally, it verifies the status of many of the controls operating within the cde. a penetration test is not truly a “test” because the outcome of a penetration test is not something that can be classified as a “pass” or a “fail.” the best outcome of a test is a catalog of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that an entity.

Guidance:
Purpose: The results of a penetration test are usually a prioritized list of vulnerabilities discovered by the exercise. often a tester will have chained a number of vulnerabilities together to compromise a system component. remediating the vulnerabilities found by a penetration test significantly reduces the probability that the same vulnerabilities will be exploited by a malicious attacker. using the entity’s own vulnerability risk assessment process (see requirement 6.3.1) ensures that the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to the entity will be remediated more quickly.

Purpose: Entities need to conduct penetration tests in accordance with pci dss to simulate attacker behavior and discover vulnerabilities in their environment. in shared and cloud environments, the multi-tenant service provider may be concerned about the activities of a penetration tester affecting other customers’ systems. multi-tenant service providers cannot forbid penetration testing because this would leave their customers’ systems open to exploitation. therefore, multi-tenant service providers must support customer requests to conduct penetration testing or for penetration testing results.","{""control_id"": ""11.4.7"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""security_testing"", ""has_testing_procedures"": false, ""requirements_id"": ""11""}"

Defined Approach Requirements:
External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.

Guidance:
Purpose: Attackers spend a lot of time finding external and internal vulnerabilities to leverage to obtain access to cardholder data and then to exfiltrate that data. as such, entities need to test their networks thoroughly, just as an attacker would do. this testing allows the entity to identify and remediate weakness that might be leveraged to compromise the entity’s network and data, and then to take appropriate actions to protect the network and system components from such attacks. Good Practice: Penetration testing techniques will differ based on an organization’s needs and structure and should be suitable for the tested environment—for example, fuzzing, injection, and forgery tests might be appropriate. the type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the needs of the organization. Definitions: Penetration tests simulate a real-world attack situation intending to identify how far an attacker could penetrate an environment, given differing amounts of information provided to the tester. this allows an entity to better understand its potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks. a penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that usually includes exploiting identified vulnerabilities. _(continued on next page)_.","{""control_id"": ""11.4"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""security_testing"", ""has_testing_procedures"": false, ""requirements_id"": ""11""}"

Testing Procedure 11.5.1.1.c: **_Additional testing procedure for_** **_service provider assessments only:_

Guidance:
Purpose: Detecting covert malware communication attempts (for example, dns tunneling) can help block the spread of malware laterally inside a network and the exfiltration of data. when deciding where to place this control, entities should consider critical locations in the network, and likely routes for covert channels. when malware establishes a foothold in an infected environment, it often tries to establish a communication channel to a command-and- control (c&c) server. through the c&c server, the attacker communicates with and controls malware on compromised systems to deliver malicious payloads or instructions, or to initiate data exfiltration. in many cases, the malware will communicate with the c&c server indirectly via botnets, bypassing monitoring, blocking controls, and rendering these methods ineffective to detect the covert channels. _(continued on next page)_. Good Practice: Methods that can help detect and address malware communications channels include real- time endpoint scanning, egress traffic filtering, an ”allow” listing, data loss prevention tools, and network security monitoring tools such as ids/ips. additionally, dns queries and responses are a key data source used by network defenders in support of incident response as well as intrusion discovery. when these transactions are collected for processing and analytics, they can enable a number of valuable security analytic scenarios. it is important that organizations maintain up-to- date knowledge of malware modes of operation, as mitigating these can help detect and limit the impact of malware in the environment.","{""control_id"": ""11.5.1.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""security_testing"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""11""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Many web pages now rely on assembling objects, including active content (primarily javascript), from multiple internet locations. additionally, the content of many web pages is defined using content management and tag management systems that may not be possible to monitor using traditional change detection mechanisms. therefore, the only place to detect changes or indicators of malicious activity is in the consumer browser as the page is constructed and all javascript interpreted. by comparing the current version of the http header and the active content of payment pages as received by the consumer browser with prior or known versions, it is possible to detect unauthorized changes that may indicate a skimming attack, or an attempt to disable a control designed to protect against, or to detect, skimming attacks. additionally, by looking for known indicators of compromise and script elements or behavior typical of skimmers, suspicious alerts can be raised. _(continued on next page)_. Examples: Mechanisms that detect and report on changes to the headers and content of the payment page could include, but are not limited to, a combination of the following techniques: violations of the content security policy (csp) can be reported to the entity using the_report-to_ or_report-uri_ csp directives. changes to the csp itself can indicate tampering. external monitoring by systems that request and analyze the received web pages (also known as synthetic user monitoring) can detect changes to javascript in payment pages and alert personnel. embedding tamper-resistant, tamper-detection script in the payment page can alert and block when malicious script behavior is detected. reverse proxies and content delivery networks can detect changes in scripts and alert personnel. the above list of mechanisms is not exhaustive, and the use of any one mechanism is not necessarily a full detection and reporting mechanism. often, these mechanisms are subscription or cloud- based, but can also be based on custom and bespoke solutions. Good Practice: Where an entity includes a tpsp’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form on its webpage, the entity should expect the tpsp/payment processor to provide evidence that the tpsp/payment processor is meeting this requirement, in accordance with the tpsp’s/payment processor’s pci dss assessment and requirement 12.9.","{""control_id"": ""11.6.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""security_testing"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""11""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Incorporating lessons learned into the incident response plan after an incident occurs and in-step with industry developments, helps keep the plan current and able to react to emerging threats and security trends. Good Practice: The lessons-learned exercise should include all levels of personnel. although it is often included as part of the review of the entire incident, it should focus on how the entity’s response to the incident could be improved. it is important to not just consider elements of the response that did not have the planned outcomes but also to understand what worked well and whether lessons from those elements that worked well can be applied to areas of the plan that did not. another way to optimize an entity’s incident response plan is to understand the attacks made against other organizations and use that information to fine-tune the entity’s detection, containment, mitigation, or recovery procedures.","{""control_id"": ""12.10.6"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""information_security_policy"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""12""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Service providers typically have access to greater volumes of cardholder data than do merchants, or can provide an entry point that can be exploited to then compromise multiple other entities. service providers also typically have larger and more complex networks that are subject to more frequent change. the probability of overlooked changes to scope in complex and dynamic networks is greater in service-providers environments. validating pci dss scope more frequently is likely to discover such overlooked changes before they can be exploited by an attacker.","{""control_id"": ""12.5.2.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""information_security_policy"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""12""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Frequent validation of pci dss scope helps to ensure pci dss scope remains up to date and aligned with changing business objectives, and therefore that security controls are protecting all appropriate system components. Good Practice: Accurate scoping involves critically evaluating the cde and all connected system components to determine the necessary coverage for pci dss requirements. scoping activities, including careful analysis and ongoing monitoring, help to ensure that in-scope systems are appropriately secured. when documenting account data locations, the entity can consider creating a table or spreadsheet that includes the following information: data stores (databases, files, cloud, etc.), including the purpose of data storage and the retention period, which chd elements are stored (pan, expiry date, cardholder name, and/or any elements of sad prior to completion of authorization), how data is secured (type of encryption and strength, hashing algorithm and strength, truncation, tokenization), how access to data stores is logged, including a description of logging mechanism(s) in use (enterprise solution, application level, operating system level, etc.). _(continued on next page)_.

Guidance:
Purpose: An organization’s structure and management define the requirements and protocol for effective and secure operations. changes to this structure could have negative effects to existing controls and frameworks by reallocating or removing resources that once supported pci dss controls or inheriting new responsibilities that may not have established controls in place. therefore, it is important to revisit pci dss scope and controls when there are changes to an organization’s structure and management to ensure controls are in place and active. Examples: Changes to organizational structure include, but are not limited to, company mergers or acquisitions, and significant changes or reassignments of personnel with responsibility for security controls.","{""control_id"": ""12.5.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""information_security_policy"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""12""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Maintaining a current list of all system components will enable an organization to define the scope of its environment and implement pci dss requirements accurately and efficiently. without an inventory, some system components could be overlooked and be inadvertently excluded from the organization’s configuration standards. Examples: Methods to maintain an inventory include as a database, as a series of files, or in an inventory- management tool. Good Practice: If an entity keeps an inventory of all assets, those system components in scope for pci dss should be clearly identifiable among the other assets. inventories should include containers or images that may be instantiated. assigning an owner to the inventory helps to ensure the inventory stays current.","{""control_id"": ""12.5"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""information_security_policy"", ""has_testing_procedures"": false, ""requirements_id"": ""12""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Performing thorough screening prior to hiring potential personnel who are expected to be given access to the cde provides entities with the information necessary to make informed risk decisions regarding personnel they hire that will have access to the cde. other benefits of screening potential personnel include helping to ensure workplace safety and confirming information provided by prospective employees on their resumes. Examples: Screening options can include, as appropriate for the entity’s region, previous employment history, review of public information/social media resources, criminal record, credit history, and reference checks. Good Practice: Entities should consider screening for existing personnel anytime they transfer into roles where they have access to the cde from roles where they did not have this access. to be effective, the level of screening should be appropriate for the position. for example, positions requiring greater responsibility or that have administrative access to critical data or systems may warrant more detailed or more frequent screening than positions with less responsibility and access.","{""control_id"": ""12.7"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""information_security_policy"", ""has_testing_procedures"": false, ""requirements_id"": ""12""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: The written acknowledgment from a tpsp demonstrates its commitment to maintaining proper security of account data that it obtains from its customers and that the tpsp is fully aware of the assets that could be affected during the provisioning of the tpsp’s service. the extent to which a specific tpsp is responsible for the security of account data will depend on the service provided and the responsibilities agreed between the provider and assessed entity (the customer). in conjunction with requirement 12.9.1, this requirement is intended to promote a consistent level of understanding between parties about their applicable pci dss responsibilities. for example, the agreement may include the applicable pci dss requirements to be maintained as part of the provided service. Good Practice: The entity may also want to consider including in their written agreement with a tpsp that the tpsp will support the entity’s request for information per requirement 12.9.2. entities will also want to understand whether any tpsps have “nested” relationships with other tpsps, meaning the primary tpsp contracts with another tpsp(s) for the purposes of providing a service. it is important to understand whether the primary tpsp is relying on the secondary tpsp(s) to achieve overall compliance of a service, and what types of written agreements the primary tpsp has in place with the secondary tpsps. entities can consider including coverage in their written agreement for any “nested” tpsps a primary tpsp may use.

Testing Procedure 12.8.5.b: Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify the entity maintains information about which PCI DSS requirements are managed by each TPSP, which are managed by the entity, and any that are shared between both entities.

Guidance:
Purpose: It is important that the entity understands which pci dss requirements and sub-requirements its tpsps have agreed to meet, which requirements are shared between the tpsp and the entity, and for those that are shared, specifics about how the requirements are shared and which entity is responsible for meeting each sub-requirement. without this shared understanding, it is inevitable that the entity and the tpsp will assume a given pci dss sub-requirement is the responsibility of the other party, and therefore that sub- requirement may not be addressed at all. the specific information an entity maintains will depend on the particular agreement with their providers, the type of service, etc. tpsps may define their pci dss responsibilities to be the same for all their customers; otherwise, this responsibility should be agreed upon by both the entity and tpsp. Good Practice: Entities can document these responsibilities via a matrix that identifies all applicable pci dss requirements and indicates for each requirement whether the entity or tpsp is responsible for meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared responsibility. this type of document is often referred to as a_responsibility matrix_. _(continued on next page)_.

Information about which PCI DSS requirements are the responsibility of the TPSP and which are the responsibility of the customer, including any shared responsibilities (Requirement 12.8.5), for any service the TPSP provides that meets a PCI DSS requirement(s) on behalf of customers or that can impact security of customers’ cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.

Customized Approach Objective:
TPSPs provide information as needed to support their customers’ PCI DSS compliance efforts.

Applicability Notes:
This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.

Guidance:
Purpose: If a tpsp does not provide the necessary information to enable its customers to meet their security and compliance requirements, the customers will not be able to protect cardholder data nor meet their own contractual obligations. Good Practice: If a tpsp has a pci dss attestation of compliance (aoc), the expectation is that the tpsp should provide that to customers upon request to demonstrate their pci dss compliance status. if the tpsp did not undergo a pci dss assessment, they may be able to provide other sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it has met the applicable requirements without undergoing a formal compliance validation. for example, the tpsp can provide specific evidence to the entity’s assessor so the assessor can confirm applicable requirements are met. alternatively, the tpsp can elect to undergo multiple on-demand assessments by each of its customers’ assessors, with each assessment targeted to confirm that applicable requirements are met. tpsps should provide sufficient evidence to their customers to verify that the scope of the tpsp’s pci dss assessment covered the services applicable to the customer and that the relevant pci dss requirements were examined and determined to be in place. _(continued on next page)_.

Testing Procedure 2.2.1.c: Examine configuration settings and interview personnel to verify that system configuration standards are applied when new systems are configured and verified as being in place before or immediately after a system component is connected to a production environment.

Guidance:
Purpose: There are known weaknesses with many operating systems, databases, network devices, software, applications, container images, and other devices used by an entity or within an entity’s environment. there are also known ways to configure these system components to fix security vulnerabilities. fixing security vulnerabilities reduces the opportunities available to an attacker. by developing standards, entities ensure their system components will be configured consistently and securely and will address the protection of devices for which full hardening may be more difficult. Good Practice: Keeping up to date with current industry guidance will help the entity maintain secure configurations. the specific controls to be applied to a system will vary and should be appropriate for the type and function of the system. numerous security organizations have established system-hardening guidelines and recommendations, which advise how to correct common, known weaknesses.

Customized Approach Objective:
System components cannot be accessed using default passwords.

Applicability Notes:
This applies to ALL vendor default accounts and passwords, including, but not limited to, those used by operating systems, software that provides security services, application and system accounts, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) defaults. This requirement also applies where a system component is not installed within an entity’s environment, for example, software and applications that are part of the CDE and are accessed via a cloud subscription service.

Testing Procedures:

Testing Procedure 2.2.2.b: Examine vendor documentation and observe a system administrator logging on using vendor default accounts to verify accounts are implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 2.2.2.c: Examine configuration files and interview personnel to verify that all vendor default accounts that will not be used are removed or disabled.

Guidance:
Purpose: Malicious individuals often use vendor default account names and passwords to compromise operating systems, applications, and the systems on which they are installed. because these default settings are often published and are well known, changing these settings will make systems less vulnerable to attack. Examples: Defaults to be considered include user ids, passwords, and other authentication credentials commonly used by vendors in their products. Good Practice: All vendor default accounts should be identified, and their purpose and use understood. it is important to establish controls for application and system accounts, including those used to deploy and maintain cloud services so that they do not use default passwords and are not usable by unauthorized individuals. where a default account is not intended to be used, changing the default password to a unique password that meets pci dss requirement 8.3.6, removing any access to the default account, and then disabling the account, will prevent a malicious individual from re-enabling the account and gaining access with the default password. using an isolated staging network to install and configure new systems is recommended and can also be used to confirm that default credentials have not been introduced into production environments.","{""control_id"": ""2.2.2"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""system_configuration"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""2""}"

Testing Procedure 2.2.3.b: Examine system configurations to verify that primary functions requiring different security levels are managed per one of the ways specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 2.2.3.c: Where virtualization technologies are used, examine the system configurations to verify that system functions requiring different security levels are managed in one of the following ways: Functions with differing security needs do not co-exist on the same system component. Functions with differing security needs that exist on the same system component are isolated from each other. Functions with differing security needs on the same system component are all secured to the level required by the function with the highest security need.

Guidance:
Purpose: Systems containing a combination of services, protocols, and daemons for their primary function will have a security profile appropriate to allow that function to operate effectively. for example, systems that need to be directly connected to the internet would have a particular profile, like a dns server, web server, or an e-commerce server. conversely, other system components may operate a primary function comprising a different set of services, protocols, and daemons that perform functions that an entity does not want exposed to the internet. this requirement aims to ensure that different functions do not impact the security profiles of other services in a way which may cause them to operate at a higher or lower security level. Good Practice: Ideally, each function should be placed on different system components. this can be achieved by implementing only one primary function on each system component. another option is to isolate primary functions on the same system component that have different security levels, for example, isolating web servers (which need to be directly connected to the internet) from application and database servers. _(continued on next page)_.","{""control_id"": ""2.2.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""system_configuration"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""2""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Unnecessary services and functions can provide additional opportunities for malicious individuals to gain access to a system. by removing or disabling all unnecessary services, protocols, daemons, and functions, organizations can focus on securing the functions that are required and reduce the risk that unknown or unnecessary functions will be exploited. Examples: Unnecessary functionality may include, but is not limited to scripts, drivers, features, subsystems, file systems, interfaces (usb and bluetooth), and unnecessary web servers. Good Practice: There are many protocols that could be enabled by default that are commonly used by malicious individuals to compromise a network. disabling or removing all services, functions, and protocols that are not used minimizes the potential attack surface—for example, by removing or disabling an unused ftp or web server.","{""control_id"": ""2.2.4"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""system_configuration"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""2""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Ensuring that all insecure services, protocols, and daemons are adequately secured with appropriate security features makes it more difficult for malicious individuals to exploit common points of compromise within a network. Good Practice: Enabling security features before new system components are deployed will prevent insecure configurations from being introduced into the environment. some vendor solutions may provide additional security functions to assist with securing an insecure process.

Testing Procedure 2.2.7.d: Examine vendor documentation and interview personnel to verify that strong cryptography for the technology in use is implemented according to industry best practices and/or vendor recommendations.

Guidance:
Purpose: If non-console (including remote) administration does not use encrypted communications, administrative authorization factors (such as ids and passwords) can be revealed to an eavesdropper. a malicious individual could use this information to access the network, become administrator, and steal data. Examples: Cleartext protocols (such as http, telnet, etc.) do not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy for an eavesdropper to intercept this information. non-console access may be facilitated by technologies that provide alternative access to systems, including but not limited to, out-of-band (oob), lights-out management (lom), intelligent platform management interface (ipmi), and keyboard, video, mouse (kvm) switches with remote capabilities. these and other non-console access technologies and methods must be secured with strong cryptography. Good Practice: Whichever security protocol is used, it should be configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection—for example, by using only trusted certificates, supporting only strong encryption, and not supporting fallback to weaker, insecure protocols or methods.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 3.1.1: Examine documentation and interview personnel to verify that security policies and operational procedures identified in Requirement 3 are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Requirement 3.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout requirement 3. while it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in requirement 3, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated. Good Practice: It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. for this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle.

Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention policy. A process for verifying, at least once every three months, that stored account data exceeding the defined retention period has been securely deleted or rendered unrecoverable.

Guidance:
Purpose: A formal data retention policy identifies what data needs to be retained, for how long, and where that data resides so it can be securely destroyed or deleted as soon as it is no longer needed. the only account data that may be stored after authorization is the primary account number or pan (rendered unreadable), expiration date, cardholder name, and service code. the storage of sad data prior to the completion of the authorization process is also included in the data retention and disposal policy so that storage of this sensitive data is kept to minimum, and only retained for the defined amount of time. Examples: An automated, programmatic procedure could be run to locate and remove data, or a manual review of data storage areas could be performed. whichever method is used, it is a good idea to monitor the process to ensure it is completed successfully, and that the results are recorded and validated as being complete. implementing secure deletion methods ensures that the data cannot be retrieved when it is no longer needed. Good Practice: When identifying locations of stored account data, consider all processes and personnel with access to the data, as data could have been moved and stored in different locations than originally defined. storage locations that are often overlooked include backup and archive systems, removable data storage devices, paper-based media, and audio recordings. to define appropriate retention requirements, an entity first needs to understand its own business needs as well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to its industry or to the type of data being retained. implementing an automated process to ensure data is automatically and securely deleted upon its defined retention limit can help ensure that account data is not retained beyond what is necessary for business, legal, or regulatory purposes. _(continued on next page)_.

PAN is masked when displayed (the BIN and last four digitsare the maximum number of digits to be displayed), such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can seemore than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN. __

Applicability Notes:
This requirement does not supersede stricter requirements in place for displays of cardholder data— for example, legal or payment brand requirements for point-of-sale (POS) receipts. This requirement relates to protection of PAN where it is displayed on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc., and is not to be confused with Requirement 3.5.1 for protection of PAN when stored, processed, or transmitted.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 3.4.1.a: Examine documented policies and procedures for masking the display of PANs to verify: A list of roles that need access to more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN (includes full PAN) is documented, together with a legitimate business need for each role to have such access. PAN is masked when displayed such that only personnel with a legitimate business need can see more than the BIN and last four digits of the PAN. All roles not specifically authorized to see the full PAN must only see masked PANs.
Testing Procedure 3.4.1.b: Examine system configurations to verify that full PAN is only displayed for roles with a documented business need, and that PAN is masked for all other requests.
Testing Procedure 3.4.1.c: Examine displays of PAN (for example, on screen, on paper receipts) to verify that PANs are masked when displayed, and that only those with a legitimate business need are able to see more than the BIN and/or last four digits of the PAN.

Guidance:
Purpose: The display of full pan on computer screens, payment card receipts, paper reports, etc. can result in this data being obtained by unauthorized individuals and used fraudulently. ensuring that the full pan is displayed only for those with a legitimate business need minimizes the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to pan data. Good Practice: Applying access controls according to defined roles is one way to limit access to viewing full pan to only those individuals with a defined business need. the masking approach should always display only the number of digits needed to perform a specific business function. for example, if only the last four digits are needed to perform a business function, pan should be masked to only show the last four digits. as another example, if a function needs to view the bank identification number (bin) for routing purposes, unmask only the bin digits for that function. _(continued on next page)_. Definitions: Masking is not synonymous with truncation and these terms cannot be used interchangeably. masking refers to the concealment of certain digits during display or printing, even when the entire pan is stored on a system. this is different from truncation, in which the truncated digits are removed and cannot be retrieved within the system. masked pan could be “unmasked”, but there is no ""un-truncation"" without recreating the pan from another source. refer to_appendix g_ for definitions of “masking” and “truncation.”.

Testing Procedure 3.4.2.c: Observe processes and interview personnel to verify that only personnel with documented, explicit authorization and a legitimate, defined business need have permission to copy and/or relocate PAN when using remote- access technologies.

Guidance:
Purpose: Relocation of pan to unauthorized storage devices is a common way for this data to be obtained and used fraudulently. methods to ensure that only those with explicit authorization and a legitimate business reason can copy or relocate pan minimizes the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to pan. Good Practice: Copying and relocation of pan should only be done to storage devices that are permissible and authorized for that individual.

Testing Procedure 3.5.1.3.b: Examine files containing authentication factors (passwords, passphrases, or cryptographic keys) and interview personnel to verify that authentication factors that allow access to unencrypted data are stored securely and are independent from the native operating system’s authentication and access control methods.

Guidance:
Purpose: Disk-level encryption typically encrypts the entire disk or partition using the same key, with all data automatically decrypted when the system runs or when an authorized user requests it. many disk-encryption solutions intercept operating system read/write operations and perform the appropriate cryptographic transformations without any special action by the user other than supplying a password or passphrase at system start-up or at the beginning of a session. this provides no protection from a malicious individual that has already managed to gain access to a valid user account. Good Practice: Full disk encryption helps to protect data in the event of physical loss of a disk and therefore its use is best limited only to removable electronic media storage devices.","{""control_id"": ""3.5.1.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""data_protection"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""3""}"

Defined Approach Requirements:
PAN is rendered unreadable anywhere it is stored by using any of the following approaches: One-way hashes based on strong cryptography of the entire PAN. Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN). – If hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN, or different truncation formats of the same PAN, are present in an environment, additional controls are in place such that the different versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. Index tokens. Strong cryptography with associated key- management processes and procedures.

Customized Approach Objective:
Cleartext PAN cannot be read from storage media.

Applicability Notes:
This requirement applies to PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception, or troubleshooting logs). This requirement does not preclude the use of temporary files containing cleartext PAN while encrypting and decrypting PAN.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 3.5.1.a: Examine documentation about the system used to render PAN unreadable, including the vendor, type of system/process, and the encryption algorithms (if applicable) to verify that the PAN is rendered unreadable using any of the methods specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 3.5.1.b: Examine data repositories and audit logs, including payment application logs, to verify the PAN is rendered unreadable using any of the methods specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 3.5.1.c: If hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in the environment, examine implemented controls to verify that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN.

Guidance:
Purpose: Rendering stored pan unreadable is a defense in depth control designed to protect the data if an unauthorized individual gains access to stored data by taking advantage of a vulnerability or misconfiguration of an entity’s primary access control. Good Practice: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original pan data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed versions of a pan. controls that prevent the correlation of this data will help ensure that the original pan remains unreadable. implementing keyed cryptographic hashes with associated key management processes and procedures in accordance with requirement 3.5.1.1 is a valid additional control to prevent correlation.

Cleartext secret or private keys cannot be known by anyone. Operations involving cleartext keys cannot be carried out by a single person.

Applicability Notes:
This control is applicable for manual key- management operations. A cryptographic key that is simply split into two parts does not meet this requirement. Secret or private keys stored as key components or key shares must be generated via one of the following: Using an approved random number generator and within a secure cryptographic device (SCD), such as a hardware security module (HSM) or PTS-approved point-of-interaction device, **OR** According to ISO 19592 or equivalent industry standard for generation of secret key shares.

Testing Procedure 3.7.6.b: Interview personnel and/or observe processes to verify that manual cleartext keys are managed with split knowledge and dual control.

Guidance:
Purpose: If an attacker is able to substitute an entity’s key with a key the attacker knows, the attacker will be able to decrypt all data encrypted with that key. Examples: Key-management operations that might be performed manually include, but are not limited to, key generation, transmission, loading, storage, and destruction. Good Practice: The encryption solution should not allow for or accept substitution of keys from unauthorized sources or unexpected processes. controls should include ensuring that individuals with access to key components or shares do not have access to other components or shares that form the necessary threshold to derive the key. Definitions: Split knowledge is a method in which two or more people separately have key components, where each person knows only their own key component, and the individual key components convey no knowledge of other components or of the original cryptographic key. dual control requires two or more people to authenticate the use of a cryptographic key or perform a key-management function. no single person can access or use the authentication factor (for example, the password, pin, or key) of another.

Testing Procedure 4.2.1.c: Examine cardholder data transmissions to verify that all PAN is encrypted with strong cryptography when it is transmitted over open, public networks.
Testing Procedure 4.2.1.d: Examine system configurations to verify that keys and/or certificates that cannot be verified as trusted are rejected.

Guidance:
Purpose: Sensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public networks because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit. Examples: Open, public networks include, but are not limited to: the internet and wireless technologies, including wi-fi, bluetooth, cellular technologies, and satellite communications. Good Practice: The network and data-flow diagrams defined in requirement 1 are useful resources for identifying all connection points where account data is transmitted or received over open, public networks. while not required, it is considered a good practice for entities to also encrypt pan over their internal networks, and for entities to establish any new network implementations with encrypted communications. pan transmissions can be protected by encrypting the data before it is transmitted, or by encrypting the session over which the data is transmitted, or both. while it is not required that strong cryptography be applied at both the data level and the session level, it is strongly recommended. if encrypted at the data level, the cryptographic keys used for protecting the data can be managed in accordance with requirements 3.6 and 3.7. if the data is encrypted at the session level, designated key custodians should be assigned responsibility for managing transmission keys and certificates. _(continued on next page)_.

Cleartext PAN cannot be read or intercepted from transmissions using end-user messaging technologies.

Applicability Notes:
This requirement also applies if a customer, or other third party, requests that PAN is sent to them via end-user messaging technologies. There could be occurrences where an entity receives unsolicited cardholder data via an insecure communication channel that was not intended for transmissions of sensitive data. In this situation, the entity can choose to either include the channel in the scope of their CDE and secure it according to PCI DSS or delete the cardholder data and implement measures to prevent the channel from being used for cardholder data.

Guidance:
Purpose: Periodic scans can identify malware that is present, but currently inactive, within the environment. some malware, such as zero-day malware, can enter an environment before the scan solution is capable of detecting it. performing regular periodic scans or continuous behavioral analysis of systems or processes helps ensure that previously undetectable malware can be identified, removed, and investigated to determine how it gained access to the environment. Good Practice: Using a combination of periodic scans (scheduled and on-demand) and active, real-time (on-access) scanning helps ensure that malware residing in both static and dynamic elements of the cde is addressed. users should also be able to run on- demand scans on their systems if suspicious activity is detected – this can be useful in the early detection of malware. scans should include the entire file system, including all disks, memory, and start-up files and boot records (at system restart) to detect all malware upon file execution, including any software that may be resident on a system but not currently active. scan scope should include all systems and software in the cde, including those that are often overlooked such as email servers, web browsers, and instant messaging software.

Defined Approach Requirements:
Anti-malware mechanisms cannot be disabled or altered by users, unless specifically documented, and authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period.

Applicability Notes:
Anti-malware solutions may be temporarily disabled only if there is a legitimate technical need, as authorized by management on a case-by-case basis. If anti-malware protection needs to be disabled for a specific purpose, it must be formally authorized. Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period during which anti-malware protection is not active.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 5.3.5.a: Examine anti-malware configurations, to verify that the anti-malware mechanisms cannot be disabled or altered by users.
Testing Procedure 5.3.5.b: Interview responsible personnel and observe processes to verify that any requests to disable or alter anti-malware mechanisms are specifically documented and authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited time period.

Guidance:
Purpose: It is important that defensive mechanisms are always running so that malware is detected in real time. ad-hoc starting and stopping of anti-malware solutions could allow malware to propagate unchecked and undetected. Examples: Additional security measures that may need to be implemented for the period during which anti- malware protection is not active include disconnecting the unprotected system from the internet while the anti-malware protection is disabled and running a full scan once it is re- enabled. Good Practice: Where there is a legitimate need to temporarily disable a system’s anti-malware protection—for example, to support a specific maintenance activity or investigation of a technical problem—the reason for taking such action should be understood and approved by an appropriate management representative. any disabling or altering of anti- malware mechanisms, including on administrators’ own devices, should be performed by authorized personnel. it is recognized that administrators have privileges that may allow them to disable anti- malware on their own computers, but there should be alerting mechanisms in place when such software is disabled and then follow up that occurs to ensure correct processes were followed.","{""control_id"": ""5.3.5"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""malware_protection"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""5""}"

Processes and automated mechanisms are in place to detect and protect personnel against phishing attacks.

Customized Approach Objective:
Mechanisms are in place to protect against and mitigate risk posed by phishing attacks.

Applicability Notes:
The focus of this requirement is on protecting personnel with access to system components in- scope for PCI DSS. Meeting this requirement for technical and automated controls to detect and protect personnel against phishing is not the same as Requirement 12.6.3.1 for security awareness training. Meeting this requirement does not also meet the requirement for providing personnel with security awareness training, and vice versa. _This requirement is a best practice until 31 March_ _2025, after which it will be required and must be_ _fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment._

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 5.4.1: Observe implemented processes and examine mechanisms to verify controls are in place to detect and protect personnel against phishing attacks.

Guidance:
Purpose: Technical controls can limit the number of occasions personnel have to evaluate the veracity of a communication and can also limit the effects of individual responses to phishing. Good Practice: When developing anti-phishing controls, entities are encouraged to consider a combination of approaches. for example, using anti-spoofing controls such as domain-based message authentication, reporting & conformance (dmarc), sender policy framework (spf), and domain keys identified mail (dkim) will help stop phishers from spoofing the entity’s domain and impersonating personnel. the deployment of technologies for blocking phishing emails and malware before they reach personnel, such as link scrubbers and server-side anti-malware, can reduce incidents and decrease the time required by personnel to check and report phishing attacks. additionally, training personnel to recognize and report phishing emails can allow similar emails to be identified and permit them to be removed before being opened. it is recommended (but not required) that anti- phishing controls are applied across an entity’s entire organization. _(continued on next page)_. Definitions: Phishing is a form of social engineering and describes the different methods used by attackers to trick personnel into disclosing sensitive information, such as user account names and passwords, and account data. attackers will typically disguise themselves and attempt to appear as a genuine or trusted source, directing personnel to send an email response, click on a web link, or enter data into a compromised website. mechanisms that can detect and prevent phishing attempts are often included in anti-malware solutions.

Testing Procedure 6.2.3.b: Examine evidence of changes to bespoke and custom software to verify that the code changes were reviewed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Security vulnerabilities in bespoke and custom software are commonly exploited by malicious individuals to gain access to a network and compromise account data. vulnerable code is far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released into production environments. requiring a formal review and signoff by management prior to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been developed in accordance with policies and procedures. Good Practice: The following items should be considered for inclusion in code reviews: searching for undocumented features (implant tools, backdoors). confirming that software securely uses external components’ functions (libraries, frameworks, apis, etc.). for example, if a third-party library providing cryptographic functions is used, verify that it was integrated securely. checking for correct use of logging to prevent sensitive data from getting into logs. analysis of insecure code structures that may contain potential vulnerabilities related to common software attacks identified in requirement 6.2.4. checking the application’s behavior to detect logical vulnerabilities.","{""control_id"": ""6.2.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""secure_development"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""6""}"

Testing Procedure 6.3.1.b: Interview responsible personnel, examine documentation, and observe processes to verify that security vulnerabilities are identified and managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Classifying the risks (for example, as critical, high, medium, or low) allows organizations to identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items more quickly and reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be exploited. Examples: Some organizations that issue alerts to advise entities about urgent vulnerabilities requiring immediate patches/updates are national computer emergency readiness/response teams (certs) and vendors. criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include criticality of a vulnerability identified in an alert from forum of incident response and security teams (first) or a cert, consideration of the cvss score, the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected. Good Practice: Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk-assessment strategy. when an entity is assigning its risk rankings, it should consider using a formal, objective, justifiable methodology that accurately portrays the risks of the vulnerabilities pertinent to the organization and translates to an appropriate entity-assigned priority for resolution. risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a “high risk” to the environment. in addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered “critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. _(continued on next page)_. Further Information: Trustworthy sources for vulnerability information include vendor websites, industry newsgroups, mailing lists, etc. if software is developed in-house, the internal development team should also consider sources of information about new vulnerabilities that may affect internally developed applications. other methods to ensure new vulnerabilities are identified include solutions that automatically recognize and alert upon detection of unusual behavior. processes should account for widely published exploits as well as “zero-day” attacks, which target previously unknown vulnerabilities. for bespoke and custom software, the organization may obtain information about libraries, frameworks, compilers, programming languages, etc. from public trusted sources (for example, special resources and resources from component developers). the organization may also independently analyze third- party components and identify vulnerabilities. _(continued on next page)_.","{""control_id"": ""6.3.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""secure_development"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""6""}"

Examples: An example time frame for installation of patches/updates could be 60 days for high-risk vulnerabilities and 90 days for others, as determined by the entity’s assessment of risk. Good Practice: Prioritizing security patches/updates for critical infrastructure ensures that high-priority systems and devices are protected from vulnerabilities as soon as possible after a patch is released. an entity’s patching cadence should factor in any re- evaluation of vulnerabilities and subsequent changes in the criticality of a vulnerability per requirement 6.3.1. for example, a vulnerability initially identified as low risk could become a higher risk later. additionally, vulnerabilities individually considered to be low or medium risk could collectively pose a high or critical risk if present on the same system, or if exploited on a low-risk system that could result in access to the cde. _(continued on next page)_.","{""control_id"": ""6.3.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""secure_development"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""6""}"

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 6.4.1: For public-facing web applications, ensure that either one of the required methods is in place as follows: If manual or automated vulnerability security assessment tools or methods are in use, examine documented processes, interview personnel, and examine records of application security assessments to verify that public- facing web applications are reviewed in accordance with all elements of this requirement specific to the tool/method.

Guidance:
Purpose: Public-facing web applications are those that are available to the public (not only for internal use). these applications are primary targets for attackers, and poorly coded web applications provide an easy path for attackers to gain access to sensitive data and systems. Examples: A web application firewall (waf) installed in front of public-facing web applications to check all traffic is an example of an automated technical solution that detects and prevents web-based attacks (for example, the attacks included in requirement 6.2.4). wafs filter and block non-essential traffic at the application layer. a properly configured waf helps to prevent application-layer attacks on applications that are improperly coded or configured. _(continued on next page)_.

Testing Procedure 6.4.3.b: Interview responsible personnel and examine inventory records and system configurations to verify that all payment page scripts that are loaded and executed in the consumer’s browser are managed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Scripts loaded and executed in the payment page can have their functionality altered without the entity’s knowledge and can also have the functionality to load additional external scripts (for example, advertising and tracking, tag management systems). such seemingly harmless scripts can be used by potential attackers to upload malicious scripts that can read and exfiltrate cardholder data from the consumer browser. ensuring that the functionality of all such scripts is understood to be necessary for the operation of the payment page minimizes the number of scripts that could be tampered with. ensuring that scripts have been explicitly authorized reduces the probability of unnecessary scripts being added to the payment page without appropriate management approval. where it is impractical for such authorization to occur before a script is changed or a new script is added to the page, the authorization should be confirmed as soon as possible after a change is made. using techniques to prevent tampering with the script will minimize the probability of the script being modified to carry out unauthorized behavior, such as skimming the cardholder data from the payment page. _(continued on next page)_. Examples: The integrity of scripts can be enforced by several different mechanisms including, but not limited to: sub-resource integrity (sri), which allows the consumer browser to validate that a script has not been tampered with. a csp, which limits the locations the consumer browser can load a script from and transmit account data to. proprietary script or tag-management systems, which can prevent malicious script execution. Good Practice: Scripts may be authorized by manual or automated (e.g., workflow) processes. where the payment page will be loaded into an inline frame (iframe), restricting the location that the payment page can be loaded from, using the parent page’s content security policy (csp) can help prevent unauthorized content being substituted for the payment page. where an entity includes a tpsp’s/payment processor’s embedded payment page/form on its webpage, the entity should expect the tpsp/payment processor to provide evidence that the tpsp/payment processor is meeting this requirement, in accordance with the tpsp’s/payment processor’s pci dss assessment and requirement 12.9.","{""control_id"": ""6.4.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""secure_development"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""6""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Change management procedures must be applied to all changes—including the addition, removal, or modification of any system component—in the production environment. it is important to document the reason for a change and the change description so that relevant parties understand and agree the change is needed. likewise, documenting the impacts of the change allows all affected parties to plan appropriately for any processing changes. Good Practice: Approval by authorized parties confirms that the change is legitimate and that the change is sanctioned by the organization. changes should be approved by individuals with the appropriate authority and knowledge to understand the impact of the change. thorough testing by the entity confirms that the security of the environment is not reduced by implementing a change and that all existing security controls either remain in place or are replaced with equal or stronger security controls after the change. the specific testing to be performed will vary according to the type of change and system component(s) affected. for each change, it is important to have documented procedures that address any failures and provide instructions on how to return to a secure state in case the change fails or adversely affects the security of an application or system. these procedures will allow the application or system to be restored to its previous secure state.","{""control_id"": ""6.5.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""secure_development"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""6""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Defining an access control model that is appropriate for the entity’s technology and access control philosophy supports a consistent and uniform way of allocating access and reduces the possibility of errors such as the granting of excessive rights. Good Practice: A factor to consider when defining access needs is the separation of duties principle. this principle is intended to prevent fraud and misuse or theft of resources. for example, 1) dividing mission- critical functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or functions, 2) establishing roles such that information system support activities are performed by different functions/individuals (for example, system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security), and 3) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. in environments where one individual performs multiple functions, such as administration and security operations, duties may be assigned so that no single individual has end-to-end control of a process without an independent checkpoint. for example, responsibility for configuration and responsibility for approving changes could be assigned to separate individuals. _(continued on next page)_.","{""control_id"": ""7.2.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""access_control_general"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""7""}"

Good Practice: Access rights are granted to a user by assignment to one or several functions. access is assigned depending on the specific user functions and with the minimum scope required for the job. when assigning privileged access, it is important to assign individuals only the privileges they need to perform their job (the “least privileges”). for example, the database administrator or backup administrator should not be assigned the same privileges as the overall systems administrator. once needs are defined for user functions (per pci dss requirement 7.2.1), it is easy to grant individuals access according to their job classification and function by using the already- created roles. entities may wish to consider use of privileged access management (pam), which is a method to grant access to privileged accounts only when those privileges are required, immediately revoking that access once they are no longer needed.","{""control_id"": ""7.2.2"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""access_control_general"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""7""}"

Testing Procedure 7.2.4.b: Interview responsible personnel and examine documented results of periodic reviews of user accounts to verify that all the results are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Regular review of access rights helps to detect excessive access rights remaining after user job responsibilities change, system functions change, or other modifications. if excessive user rights are not revoked in due time, they may be used by malicious users for unauthorized access. this review provides another opportunity to ensure that accounts for all terminated users have been removed (if any were missed at the time of termination), as well as to ensure that any third parties that no longer need access have had their access terminated. Good Practice: When a user transfers into a new role or a new department, typically the privileges and access associated with their former role are no longer required. continued access to privileges or functions that are no longer required may introduce the risk of misuse or errors. therefore, when responsibilities change, processes that revalidate access help to ensure user access is appropriate for the user’s new responsibilities. entities can consider implementing a regular, repeatable process for conducting reviews of access rights, and assigning “data owners” that are responsible for managing and monitoring access to data related to their job function and that also ensure user access remains current and appropriate. as an example, a direct manager could review team access monthly, while the senior manager reviews their groups’ access quarterly, both making updates to access as needed. the intent of these best practices is to support and facilitate conducting the reviews at least once every 6 months.","{""control_id"": ""7.2.4"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""access_control_general"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""7""}"

Testing Procedure 7.2.6.b: Examine configuration settings for querying repositories of stored cardholder data to verify they are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: The misuse of query access to repositories of cardholder data has been a regular cause of data breaches. limiting such access to administrators reduces the risk of such access being abused by unauthorized users. Good Practice: Typical user actions include moving, copying, and deleting data. also consider the scope of privilege needed when granting access. for example, access can be granted to specific objects such as data elements, files, tables, indexes, views, and stored routines. granting access to repositories of cardholder data should follow the same process as all other granted access, meaning that it is based on roles, with only the privileges assigned to each user that are needed to perform their job functions. Definitions: “programmatic methods” means granting access through means such as database stored procedures that allow users to perform controlled actions to data in a table, rather than via direct, unfiltered access to the data repository by end users (except for the responsible administrator(s), who need direct access to the database for their administrative duties).","{""control_id"": ""7.2.6"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""access_control_general"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""7""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Service providers with remote access to customer premises typically use this access to support pos poi systems or provide other remote services. if a service provider uses the same authentication factors to access multiple customers, all the service provider’s customers can easily be compromised if an attacker compromises that one factor. criminals know this and deliberately target service providers looking for a shared authentication factor that gives them remote access to many merchants via that single factor. _(continued on next page)_.

If a user session has been idle for more than 15 minutes, the user is required to re-authenticate to re-activate the terminal or session.

Customized Approach Objective:

Applicability Notes:
This requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts on point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction. This requirement is not meant to prevent legitimate activities from being performed while the console/PC is unattended.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 8.2.8: Examine system configuration settings to verify that system/session idle timeout features for user sessions have been set to 15 minutes or less.

Guidance:
Purpose: When users walk away from an open machine with access to system components or cardholder data, there is a risk that the machine may be used by others in the user’s absence, resulting in unauthorized account access and/or misuse. Examples: One way to meet this requirement is to configure an automated screensaver to launch whenever the console is idle for 15 minutes and requiring the logged-in user to enter their password to unlock the screen. Good Practice: The re-authentication can be applied either at the system level to protect all sessions running on that machine or at the application level. entities may also want to consider staging controls in succession to further restrict the access of an unattended session as time passes. for example, the screensaver may activate after 15 minutes and log off the user after an hour. however, timeout controls must balance the risk of access and exposure with the impact to the user and purpose of the access. if a user needs to run a program from an unattended computer, the user can log in to the computer to initiate the program, and then “lock” the computer so that no one else can use the user’s login while the computer is unattended.","{""control_id"": ""8.2.8"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""user_identification"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""8""}"

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 8.3.6: Examine system configuration settings to verify that user password/passphrase complexity parameters are set in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Strong passwords/passphrases may be the first line of defense into a network since a malicious individual will often first try to find accounts with weak, static, or non-existent passwords. if passwords are short or easily guessable, it is relatively easy for a malicious individual to find these weak accounts and compromise a network under the guise of a valid user id. Good Practice: Password/passphrase strength is dependent on password/passphrase complexity, length, and randomness. passwords/passphrases should be sufficiently complex, so they are impractical for an attacker to guess or otherwise discover its value. entities can consider adding increased complexity by requiring the use of special characters and upper- and lower-case characters, in addition to the minimum standards outlined by this requirement. additional complexity increases the time required for offline brute force attacks of hashed passwords/passphrases. another option for increasing the resistance of passwords to guessing attacks is by comparing proposed password/passphrases to a bad password list and having users provide new passwords for any passwords found on the list.","{""control_id"": ""8.3.6"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""user_identification"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""8""}"

Testing Procedure 8.5.1.e: Observe personnel connecting remotely from outside the entity’s network to verify that access is granted only after all authentication factors are successful.

Guidance:
Purpose: Poorly configured mfa systems can be bypassed by attackers. this requirement therefore addresses configuration of mfa system(s) that provide mfa for users accessing system components in the cde. Examples: Examples of methods to help protect against replay attacks include, but are not limited to: unique session identifiers and session keys timestamps time-based, one-time passwords or passcodes anti-replay mechanisms that detect and reject duplicated authentication attempts. _(continued on next page)_. Definitions: Using one type of factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi- factor authentication. a replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a valid transmission of data and then resends or redirects this communication for malicious purposes. in mfa implementations, replay attacks are typically used to gain unauthorized access by leveraging legitimate credentials.

Testing Procedure 8.6.3.c: Interview responsible personnel and examine system configuration settings to verify that passwords/passphrases for any application and system accounts are protected against misuse in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Systems and application accounts pose more inherent security risk than user accounts because they often run in an elevated security context, with access to systems that may not be typically granted to user accounts, such as programmatic access to databases, etc. as a result, special consideration must be made to protect passwords/passphrases used for application and system accounts. Good Practice: Entities should consider the following risk factors when determining how to protect application and system passwords/passphrases against misuse: how securely the passwords/passphrases are stored (for example, whether they are stored in a password vault). staff turnover. the number of people with access to the authentication factor. whether the account can be used for interactive login. whether the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access to resources is automatically determined accordingly (see requirement 8.3.9). all these elements affect the level of risk for application and system accounts and might impact the security of systems accessed by the system and application accounts. _(continued on next page)_.

Guidance:
Purpose: Entities are best placed to determine the frequency of poi device inspections based on the environment in which the device operates. Good Practice: The frequency of inspections will depend on factors such as the location of a device and whether the device is attended or unattended. for example, devices left in public areas without supervision by the organization’s personnel might have more frequent inspections than devices kept in secure areas or supervised when accessible to the public. in addition, many poi vendors include guidance in their user documentation about how often poi devices should be checked, and for what – entities should consult their vendors’ documentation and incorporate those recommendations into their periodic inspections.","{""control_id"": ""9.5.1.2.1"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""physical_access"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""9""}"

Testing Procedure 9.5.1.2: POI device surfaces are periodically inspected to detect tampering and unauthorized substitution.

Guidance:
Purpose: Regular inspections of devices will help organizations detect tampering more quickly via external evidence—for example, the addition of a card skimmer—or replacement of a device, thereby minimizing the potential impact of using fraudulent devices. Examples: The type of inspection will depend on the device. for instance, photographs of devices known to be secure can be used to compare a device’s current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a uv light marker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect such activities. device vendors may also provide security guidance and “how to” guides to help determine whether the device has been subject to tampering. signs that a device might have been tampered with or substituted include: unexpected attachments or cables plugged into the device. missing or changed security labels. broken or differently colored casing. changes to the serial number or other external markings.

Procedures to ensure devices are not installed, replaced, or returned without verification. Being aware of suspicious behavior around devices. Reporting suspicious behavior and indications of device tampering or substitution to appropriate personnel.

Guidance:
Purpose: Criminals will often pose as authorized maintenance personnel to gain access to poi devices. Examples: Suspicious behavior that personnel should be aware of includes attempts by unknown persons to unplug or open devices. ensuring personnel are aware of mechanisms for reporting suspicious behavior and who to report such behavior to—for example, a manager or security officer—will help reduce the likelihood and potential impact of a device being tampered with or substituted. Good Practice: Personnel training should include being alert to and questioning anyone who shows up to do poi maintenance to ensure they are authorized and have a valid work order, including any agents, maintenance or repair personnel, technicians, service providers, or other third parties. all third parties requesting access to devices should always be verified before being provided access—for example, by checking with management or phoning the poi maintenance company, such as the vendor or acquirer, for verification. many criminals will try to fool personnel by dressing for the part (for example, carrying toolboxes and dressed in work apparel), and could also be knowledgeable about locations of devices, so personnel should be trained to always follow procedures. another trick that criminals use is to send a “new” poi device with instructions for swapping it with a legitimate device and “returning” the legitimate device. the criminals may even provide return postage to their specified address. therefore, personnel should always verify with their manager or supplier that the device is legitimate and came from a trusted source before installing it or using it for business. _(continued on next page)_.","{""control_id"": ""9.5.1.3"", ""standard"": ""PCI-DSS-v4.0"", ""source"": ""PCI_DSS_PDF_v4.0"", ""control_category"": ""physical_access"", ""has_testing_procedures"": true, ""requirements_id"": ""9""}"

Guidance:
Purpose: Pci dss normally requires segmentation controls to be verified by penetration testing every twelve months. validating segmentation controls more frequently is likely to discover failings in segmentation before they can be exploited by an attacker attempting to pivot laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted network to the cde. Good Practice: Although the requirement specifies that this scope validation is carried out at least once every six months and after a significant change, this exercise should be performed as frequently as possible to ensure it remains effective at isolating the cde from other networks.
