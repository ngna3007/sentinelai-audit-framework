Good Practice: When logging the date and time of visit, including both in and out times is considered a best practice, since it provides helpful tracking information and provides assurance that a visitor has left at the end of the day. it is also good to verify that a visitor\u2019s id (driver\u2019s license, etc.) matches the name they put on the visitor log.",
