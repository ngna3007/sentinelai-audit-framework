  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 8.3.2 Defined Approach Requirements: Strong cryptography is used to render all authentication factors unreadable during transmission and storage on all system components. Customized Approach Objective: Cleartext authentication factors cannot be obtained, derived, or reused from the interception of communications or from stored data. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 8.3.2.a: Examine vendor documentation and system configuration settings to verify that authentication factors are rendered unreadable with strong cryptography during transmission and storage. Testing Procedure 8.3.2.b: Examine repositories of authentication factors to verify that they are unreadable during storage. Testing Procedure 8.3.2.c: Examine data transmissions to verify that authentication factors are unreadable during transmission. Guidance: Purpose: Network devices and applications have been known to transmit unencrypted, readable authentication factors (such as passwords and passphrases) across the network and/or store these values without encryption. as a result, a malicious individual can easily intercept this information during transmission using a \u201csniffer,\u201d or directly access unencrypted authentication factors in files where they are stored, and then use this data to gain unauthorized access.",
