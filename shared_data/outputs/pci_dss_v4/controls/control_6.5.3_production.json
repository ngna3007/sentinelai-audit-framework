Good Practice: Organizations must clearly understand which environments are test environments or development environments and how these environments interact on the level of networks and applications. Definitions: Pre-production environments include development, testing, user acceptance testing (uat), etc. even where production infrastructure is used to facilitate testing or development, production environments still need to be separated (logically or physically) from pre-production functionality such that vulnerabilities introduced as a result of pre-production activities do not adversely affect production systems.",
