Guidance:
Good Practice: The security policy for the organization identifies the purpose, scope, accountability, and information that clearly defines the organization’s position regarding information security. the overall information security policy differs from individual security policies that address specific technology or security disciplines. this policy sets forth the directives for the entire organization whereas individual security policies align and support the overall security policy and communicate specific objectives for technology or security disciplines. it is important that all relevant personnel within the organization, as well as relevant third parties, vendors, and business partners are aware of the organization’s information security policy and their responsibilities for protecting information assets. Definitions: “relevant” for this requirement means that the information security policy is disseminated to those with roles applicable to some or all the topics in the policy, either within the company or because of services/functions performed by a vendor or third party.
