In addition, without formalized time-<br>bound processes, attackers will have ample time<br>to compromise systems and steal account data<br>from the CDE.<br>Good Practice<br>The specific types of failures may vary, depending<br>on the function of the device system component<br>and technology in use. Typical failures include a<br>system ceasing to perform its security function or<br>not functioning in its intended manner, such as a<br>firewall erasing all its rules or going offline.|",
