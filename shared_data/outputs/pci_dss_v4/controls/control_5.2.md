PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 5.2

Defined Approach Requirements:
Malicious software (malware) is prevented, or detected and addressed.

Guidance:
Purpose: There is a constant stream of attacks targeting newly discovered vulnerabilities in systems previously regarded as secure. without an anti- malware solution that is updated regularly, new forms of malware can be used to attack systems, disable a network, or compromise data. Good Practice: It is beneficial for entities to be aware of "zero-day" attacks (those that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability) and consider solutions that focus on behavioral characteristics and will alert and react to unexpected behavior. Definitions: System components known to be affected by malware have active malware exploits available in the real world (not only theoretical exploits).
