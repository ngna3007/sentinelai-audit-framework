Good Practice: Entities should consider how to address the following when developing their processes for defining and managing exceptions and anomalies: how log review activities are recorded, how to rank and prioritize exceptions and anomalies, what procedures should be in place to report and escalate exceptions and anomalies, and who is responsible for investigating and for any remediation tasks.",
