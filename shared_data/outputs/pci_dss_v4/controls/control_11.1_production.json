Good Practice: It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. for this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle. Definitions: Security policies define the entity\u2019s security objectives and principles. operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.",
