Good Practice: An entity\u2019s inventory should cover all payment software components and dependencies, including supported execution platforms or environments, third- party libraries, services, and other required functionalities. there are many different types of solutions that can help with managing software inventories, such as software composition analysis tools, application discovery tools, and mobile device management.",
