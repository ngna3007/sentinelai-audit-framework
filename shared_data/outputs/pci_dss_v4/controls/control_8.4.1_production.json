  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 8.4.1 Defined Approach Requirements: MFA is implemented for all non-console access into the CDE for personnel with administrative access. Customized Approach Objective: Administrative access to the CDE cannot be obtained by the use of a single authentication factor. Applicability Notes: The requirement for MFA for non-console administrative access applies to all personnel with elevated or increased privileges accessing the CDE via a non-console connection\u2014that is, via logical access occurring over a network interface rather than via a direct, physical connection. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 8.4.1.a: Examine network and/or system configurations to verify MFA is required for all non- console into the CDE for personnel with administrative access. Testing Procedure 8.4.1.b: Observe administrator personnel logging into the CDE and verify that MFA is required. Guidance: Purpose: Requiring more than one type of authentication factor reduces the probability that an attacker can gain access to a system by masquerading as a legitimate user, because the attacker would need to compromise multiple authentication factors. this is especially true in environments where traditionally the single authentication factor employed was something a user knows such as a password or passphrase. Good Practice: Implementing mfa for non-console administrative access to in-scope system components that are not part of the cde will help prevent unauthorized users from using a single factor to gain access and compromise in-scope system components. Definitions: Using one factor twice (for example, using two separate passwords) is not considered multi- factor authentication.",
