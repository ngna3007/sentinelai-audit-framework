Customized Approach Objective: Media cannot leave a facility without the approval of accountable personnel. Applicability Notes: Individuals approving media movements should have the appropriate level of management authority to grant this approval. However, it is not specifically required that such individuals have “manager” as part of their title. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 9.4.4.a: Examine documentation to verify that procedures are defined to ensure that media moved outside the facility is approved by management. Testing Procedure 9.4.4.b: Examine offsite media tracking logs and interview responsible personnel to verify that proper management authorization is obtained for all media moved outside the facility (including media distributed to individuals). Guidance: Purpose: Without careful inventory methods and storage controls, stolen or missing electronic media could go unnoticed for an indefinite amount of time.
