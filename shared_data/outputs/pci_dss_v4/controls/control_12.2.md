PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.2

Defined Approach Requirements:
Acceptable use policies for end-user technologies are defined and implemented.

Guidance:
Purpose: End-user technologies are a significant investment and may pose significant risk to an organization if not managed properly. acceptable use policies outline the expected behavior from personnel when using the organization’s information technology and reflect the organization’s risk tolerance these policies instruct personnel on what they can and cannot do with company equipment and instruct personnel on correct and incorrect uses of company internet and email resources. such policies can legally protect an organization and allow it to act when the policies are violated. Good Practice: It is important that usage policies are supported by technical controls to manage the enforcement of the policies. structuring polices as simple “do” and “do not” requirements that are linked to a purpose can help remove ambiguity and provide personnel with the context for the requirement.
