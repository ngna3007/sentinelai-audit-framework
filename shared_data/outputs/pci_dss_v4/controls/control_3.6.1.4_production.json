Customized Approach Objective: Cryptographic keys are retained only where necessary. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 3.6.1.4: Examine key storage locations and observe processes to verify that keys are stored in the fewest possible locations. Guidance: Purpose: Use of strong cryptographic keys significantly increases the level of security of encrypted account data. Further Information: See the sources referenced at cryptographic key generation in_appendix g_.",
