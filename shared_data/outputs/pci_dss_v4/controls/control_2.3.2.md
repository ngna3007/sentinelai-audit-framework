PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 2.3.2

Defined Approach Requirements:
For wireless environments connected to the CDE or transmitting account data, wireless encryption keys are changed as follows: Whenever personnel with knowledge of the key leave the company or the role for which the knowledge was necessary. Whenever a key is suspected of or known to be compromised.

Customized Approach Objective:
Knowledge of wireless encryption keys cannot allow unauthorized access to wireless networks.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 2.3.2: Interview responsible personnel and examine key-management documentation to verify that wireless encryption keys are changed in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Changing wireless encryption keys whenever someone with knowledge of the key leaves the organization or moves to a role that no longer requires knowledge of the key, helps keep knowledge of keys limited to only those with a business need to know. also, changing wireless encryption keys whenever a key is suspected or known to be comprised makes a wireless network more resistant to compromise. Good Practice: This goal can be accomplished in multiple ways, including periodic changes of keys, changing keys via a defined “joiners-movers-leavers” (jml) process, implementing additional technical controls, and not using fixed pre-shared keys. in addition, any keys that are known to be, or suspected of being, compromised should be managed in accordance with the entity’s incident response plan at requirement 12.10.1.
