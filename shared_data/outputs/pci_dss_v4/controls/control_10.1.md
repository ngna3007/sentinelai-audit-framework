PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 10.1

Defined Approach Requirements:
Processes and mechanisms for logging and monitoring all access to system components and cardholder data are defined and understood.

Guidance:
Purpose: Requirement 10.1.1 is about effectively managing and maintaining the various policies and procedures specified throughout requirement 10. while it is important to define the specific policies or procedures called out in requirement 10, it is equally important to ensure they are properly documented, maintained, and disseminated. Good Practice: It is important to update policies and procedures as needed to address changes in processes, technologies, and business objectives. for this reason, consider updating these documents as soon as possible after a change occurs and not only on a periodic cycle. Definitions: Security policies define the entityâ€™s security objectives and principles. operational procedures describe how to perform activities, and define the controls, methods, and processes that are followed to achieve the desired result in a consistent manner and in accordance with policy objectives.
