PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.8

Defined Approach Requirements:
Risk to information assets associated with third-party service provider (TPSP) relationships is managed.

Guidance:
Purpose: Maintaining a list of all tpsps identifies where potential risk extends outside the organization and defines the organization’s extended attack surface. Examples: Different types of tpsps include those that: store, process, or transmit account data on the entity’s behalf (such as payment gateways, payment processors, payment service providers (psps), and off-site storage providers). manage system components included in the entity’s pci dss assessment (such as providers of network security control services, anti-malware services, and security incident and event management (siem); contact and call centers; web-hosting companies; and iaas, paas, saas, and faas cloud providers). could impact the security of the entity’s cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data (such as vendors providing support via remote access, and bespoke software developers).
