  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 8.2.1 Defined Approach Requirements: All users are assigned a unique ID before access to system components or cardholder data is allowed. Customized Approach Objective: All actions by all users are attributable to an individual. Applicability Notes: This requirement is not intended to apply to user accounts within point-of-sale terminals that have access to only one card number at a time to facilitate a single transaction Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 8.2.1.a: Interview responsible personnel to verify that all users are assigned a unique ID for access to system components and cardholder data. Testing Procedure 8.2.1.b: Examine audit logs and other evidence to verify that access to system components and cardholder data can be uniquely identified and associated with individuals. Guidance: Purpose: The ability to trace actions performed on a computer system to an individual establishes accountability and traceability and is fundamental to establishing effective access controls. by ensuring each user is uniquely identified, instead of using one id for several employees, an organization can maintain individual responsibility for actions and an effective record in the audit log per employee. in addition, this will assist with issue resolution and containment when misuse or malicious intent occurs.",
