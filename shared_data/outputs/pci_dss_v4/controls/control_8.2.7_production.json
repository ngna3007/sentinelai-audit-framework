Use is monitored for unexpected activity.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 8.2.7: Interview personnel, examine documentation for managing accounts, and examine evidence to verify that accounts used by third parties for remote access are managed according to all elements specified in this requirement.\n\nGuidance:\nGood Practice: Enabling access only for the time periods needed and disabling it as soon as it is no longer required helps prevent misuse of these connections. additionally, consider assigning third parties a start and stop date for their access in accordance with their service contract. monitoring third-party access helps ensure that third parties are accessing only the systems necessary and only during approved time frames. any unusual activity using third-party accounts should be followed up and resolved.",
