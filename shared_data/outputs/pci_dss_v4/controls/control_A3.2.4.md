PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control A3.2.4 Defined Approach Requirements: If segmentation is used, PCI DSS scope is confirmed as follows: Per the entityâ€™s methodology defined at Requirement 11.4.1. Penetration testing is performed on segmentation controls at least once every six months and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods. The penetration testing covers all segmentation controls/methods in use. The penetration testing verifies that segmentation controls/methods are operational and effective, and isolate the CDE from all out- of-scope systems. PCI DSS Reference: _Requirement 11_ Customized Approach Objective: This requirement is not eligible for the customized approach. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure A3.2.4: Examine the results from the most recent penetration test to verify that the test was conducted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement. Guidance: Purpose: Pci dss normally requires segmentation controls to be verified by penetration testing every twelve months. validating segmentation controls more frequently is likely to discover failings in segmentation before they can be exploited by an attacker attempting to pivot laterally from an out-of-scope untrusted network to the cde. Good Practice: Although the requirement specifies that this scope validation is carried out at least once every six months and after a significant change, this exercise should be performed as frequently as possible to ensure it remains effective at isolating the cde from other networks.
