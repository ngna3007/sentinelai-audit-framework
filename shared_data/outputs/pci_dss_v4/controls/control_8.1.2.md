Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 8.1.2.a: Examine documentation to verify that descriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 8 are documented and assigned. Testing Procedure 8.1.2.b: Interview personnel with responsibility for performing activities in Requirement 8 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as documented and are understood.
