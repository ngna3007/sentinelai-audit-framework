Examples: Screening options can include, as appropriate for the entity\u2019s region, previous employment history, review of public information/social media resources, criminal record, credit history, and reference checks. Good Practice: Entities should consider screening for existing personnel anytime they transfer into roles where they have access to the cde from roles where they did not have this access. to be effective, the level of screening should be appropriate for the position. for example, positions requiring greater responsibility or that have administrative access to critical data or systems may warrant more detailed or more frequent screening than positions with less responsibility and access.",
