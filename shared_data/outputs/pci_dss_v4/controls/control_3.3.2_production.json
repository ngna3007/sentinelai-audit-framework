Good Practice: Entities should consider encrypting sad with a different cryptographic key than is used to encrypt pan. note that this does not mean that pan present in sad (as part of track data) would need to be separately encrypted. Definitions: The authorization process is completed when a merchant receives a transaction response (for example, an approval or decline) . refer to_appendix g_ for the definition of \u201cauthorization.\u201d.",
