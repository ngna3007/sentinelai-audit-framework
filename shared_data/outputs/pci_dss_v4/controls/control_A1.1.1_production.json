Customers cannot access the provider\u2019s environment without authorization. A1.1.1 Examine documentation and system and network configurations and interview personnel to verify that logical separation is implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement. Customized Approach Objective Customers cannot access the provider\u2019s environment. The provider cannot access its customers\u2019 environments without authorization. Applicability Notes _This requirement is a best practice until 31_ _March 2025, after which it will be required and_ _must be fully considered during a PCI DSS_ _assessment._\n\nCustomized Approach Objective:\nCustomers cannot access the provider\u2019s environment. The provider cannot access its customers\u2019 environments without authorization. **Applicability Notes**\n\nApplicability Notes:\n_This requirement is a best practice until 31_ _March 2025, after which it will be required and_ _must be fully considered during a PCI DSS_ _assessment._\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure A1.1.1: Examine documentation and system and network configurations and interview personnel to verify that logical separation is implemented in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: Without controls between the provider\u2019s environment and the customer\u2019s environment, a malicious actor within the provider\u2019s environment could compromise the customer\u2019s environment, and similarly, a malicious actor in a customer environment could compromise the provider and potentially other of the provider\u2019s customers. multi-tenant environments should be isolated from each other and from the provider\u2019s infrastructure such that they can be separately managed entities with no connectivity between them. Good Practice: Providers should ensure strong separation between the environments that are designed for customer access, for example, configuration and billing portals, and the provider\u2019s private environment that should only be accessed by authorized provider personnel. service provider access to customer environments is performed in accordance with requirement 8.2.3. Further Information: Refer to the_information supplement: pci ssc cloud_ _computing guidelines_ for further guidance on cloud environments.",
