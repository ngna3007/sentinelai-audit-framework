Network security controls. Change-detection mechanisms for critical files. The change-and tamper-detection mechanism for payment pages._This bullet is a best practice_ _until its effective date; refer to Applicability Notes_ _below for details._ Detection of unauthorized wireless access points. Customized Approach Objective: Alerts generated by monitoring and detection technologies are responded to in a structured, repeatable manner. Applicability Notes: _The bullet above (for monitoring and responding to_ _alerts from a change- and tamper-detection_ _mechanism for payment pages) is a best practice_ _until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required_ _as part of Requirement 12.10.5 and must be fully_ _considered during a PCI DSS assessment._ Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 12.10.5: Examine documentation and observe incident response processes to verify that monitoring and responding to alerts from security monitoring systems are covered in the security incident response plan, including but not limited to the systems specified in this requirement. Guidance: Purpose: Responding to alerts generated by security monitoring systems that are explicitly designed to focus on potential risk to data is critical to prevent a breach and therefore, this must be included in the incident-response processes.",
