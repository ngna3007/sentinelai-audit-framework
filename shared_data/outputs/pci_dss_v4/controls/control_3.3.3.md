Guidance: Purpose: Sad can be used by malicious individuals to increase the probability of successfully generating counterfeit payment cards and creating fraudulent transactions**. **. Good Practice: Entities should consider encrypting sad with a different cryptographic key than is used to encrypt pan. note that this does not mean that pan present in sad (as part of track data) would need to be separately encrypted.
