This requirement is not intended for service providers who serve as the termination or connection point to those POS POI terminals. Requirements A2.1.2 and A2.1.3 apply to POS POI service providers. The allowance for POS POI terminals that are not currently susceptible to exploits is based on currently known risks. If new exploits are introduced to which POS POI terminals are susceptible, the POS POI terminals will need to be updated immediately.",
