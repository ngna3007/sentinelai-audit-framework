  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 3.6.1\n\nDefined Approach Requirements:\nProcedures are defined and implemented to protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse that include: Access to keys is restricted to the fewest number of custodians necessary. Key-encrypting keys are at least as strong as the data-encrypting keys they protect. Key-encrypting keys are stored separately from data-encrypting keys. Keys are stored securely in the fewest possible locations and forms.\n\nCustomized Approach Objective:\nProcesses that protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse are defined and implemented.\n\nApplicability Notes:\nThis requirement applies to keys used to protect stored account data and to key-encrypting keys used to protect data-encrypting keys. The requirement to protect keys used to protect stored account data from disclosure and misuse applies to both data-encrypting keys and key- encrypting keys. Because one key-encrypting key may grant access to many data-encrypting keys, the key-encrypting keys require strong protection measures.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 3.6.1: Examine documented key-management policies and procedures to verify that processes to protect cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data against disclosure and misuse are defined to include all elements specified in this requirement.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: Cryptographic keys must be strongly protected because those who obtain access will be able to decrypt data. Good Practice: Having a centralized key management system based on industry standards is recommended for managing cryptographic keys. Further Information: The entity\u2019s key management procedures will benefit through alignment with industry requirements, sources for information on cryptographic key management life cycles include: _iso 11568-1 banking \u2014 key management (retail)_ _\u2014 part 1_: principles (specifically chapter 10 and the referenced parts 2 & 4) _nist sp 800-57 part 1 revision 5\u2014_ _recommendation for key management, part 1:_ _general_.",
