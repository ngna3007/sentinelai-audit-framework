PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 11.5.2

Defined Approach Requirements:
A change-detection mechanism (for example, file integrity monitoring tools) is deployed as follows: To alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including changes, additions, and deletions) of critical files. To perform critical file comparisons at least once weekly.

Customized Approach Objective:
Critical files cannot be modified by unauthorized personnel without an alert being generated. _(continued on next page)_

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 11.5.2.a: Examine system settings, monitored files, and results from monitoring activities to verify the use of a change-detection mechanism.
Testing Procedure 11.5.2.b: Examine settings for the change-detection mechanism to verify it is configured in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: Changes to critical system, configuration, or content files can be an indicator an attacker has accessed an organizationâ€™s system. such changes can allow an attacker to take additional malicious actions, access cardholder data, and/or conduct activities without detection or record. a change detection mechanism will detect and evaluate such changes to critical files and generate alerts that can be responded to following defined processes so that personnel can take appropriate actions. _(continued on next page)_. Examples: Change-detection solutions such as file integrity monitoring (fim) tools check for changes, additions, and deletions to critical files, and notify when such changes are detected. Good Practice: Examples of the types of files that should be monitored include, but are not limited to: system executables. application executables. configuration and parameter files. centrally stored, historical, or archived audit logs. additional critical files determined by entity (for example, through risk assessment or other means).
