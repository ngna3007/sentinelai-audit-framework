Good Practice: Entities can document these responsibilities via a matrix that identifies all applicable pci dss requirements and indicates for each requirement whether the entity or tpsp is responsible for meeting that requirement or whether it is a shared responsibility. this type of document is often referred to as a_responsibility matrix_. _(continued on next page)_. Further Information: Refer to_ information supplement: third-party_ _security assurance_for a sample responsibility matrix template.",
