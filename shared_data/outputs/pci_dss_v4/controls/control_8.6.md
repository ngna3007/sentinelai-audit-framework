PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 8.6

Defined Approach Requirements:
Use of application and system accounts and associated authentication factors is strictly managed.

Guidance:
Purpose: Like individual user accounts, system and application accounts require accountability and strict management to ensure they are used only for the intended purpose and are not misused. attackers often compromise system or application accounts to gain access to cardholder data. Good Practice: Where possible, configure system and application accounts to disallow interactive login to prevent unauthorized individuals from logging in and using the account with its associated system privileges, and to limit the machines and devices on which the account can be used. Definitions: Interactive login is the ability for a person to log into a system or application account in the same manner as a normal user account. using system and application accounts this way means there is no accountability and traceability of actions taken by the user. refer to_appendix g_ for the definition of “application and system accounts.”.
