  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 3.4.2\n\nDefined Approach Requirements:\nWhen using remote-access technologies, technical controls prevent copy and/or relocation of PAN for all personnel, except for those with documented, explicit authorization and a legitimate, defined business need.\n\nCustomized Approach Objective:\nPAN cannot be copied or relocated by unauthorized personnel using remote-access technologies.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 3.4.2.a: Examine documented policies and procedures and documented evidence for technical controls that prevent copy and/or relocation of PAN when using remote-access technologies onto local hard drives or removable electronic media to verify the following: Technical controls prevent all personnel not specifically authorized from copying and/or relocating PAN. A list of personnel with permission to copy and/or relocate PAN is maintained, together with the documented, explicit authorization and legitimate, defined business need.\nTesting Procedure 3.4.2.b: Examine configurations for remote-access technologies to verify that technical controls to prevent copy and/or relocation of PAN for all personnel, unless explicitly authorized.\nTesting Procedure 3.4.2.c: Observe processes and interview personnel to verify that only personnel with documented, explicit authorization and a legitimate, defined business need have permission to copy and/or relocate PAN when using remote- access technologies.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: Relocation of pan to unauthorized storage devices is a common way for this data to be obtained and used fraudulently. methods to ensure that only those with explicit authorization and a legitimate business reason can copy or relocate pan minimizes the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to pan. Good Practice: Copying and relocation of pan should only be done to storage devices that are permissible and authorized for that individual. Definitions: A virtual desktop is an example of a remote-access technology. such remote access technologies often include tools to disable copy and/or relocation functionality. storage devices include, but are not limited to, local hard drives, virtual drives, removable electronic media, network drives, and cloud storage. Further Information: Vendor documentation for the remote-access technology in use will provide information about the system settings needed to implement this requirement.",
