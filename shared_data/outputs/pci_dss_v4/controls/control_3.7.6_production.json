  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 3.7.6\n\nDefined Approach Requirements:\n(continued)_\nWhere manual cleartext cryptographic key- management operations are performed by personnel, key-management policies and procedures are implemented, including managing these operations using split knowledge and dual control.\n\nCustomized Approach Objective:\nCleartext secret or private keys cannot be known by anyone. Operations involving cleartext keys cannot be carried out by a single person.\n\nApplicability Notes:\nThis control is applicable for manual key- management operations. A cryptographic key that is simply split into two parts does not meet this requirement. Secret or private keys stored as key components or key shares must be generated via one of the following: Using an approved random number generator and within a secure cryptographic device (SCD), such as a hardware security module (HSM) or PTS-approved point-of-interaction device, **OR** According to ISO 19592 or equivalent industry standard for generation of secret key shares.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 3.7.6.a: Examine the documented key-management policies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data and verify that they define using split knowledge and dual control.\nTesting Procedure 3.7.6.b: Interview personnel and/or observe processes to verify that manual cleartext keys are managed with split knowledge and dual control.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: If an attacker is able to substitute an entity\u2019s key with a key the attacker knows, the attacker will be able to decrypt all data encrypted with that key. Examples: Key-management operations that might be performed manually include, but are not limited to, key generation, transmission, loading, storage, and destruction. Good Practice: The encryption solution should not allow for or accept substitution of keys from unauthorized sources or unexpected processes. controls should include ensuring that individuals with access to key components or shares do not have access to other components or shares that form the necessary threshold to derive the key. Definitions: Split knowledge is a method in which two or more people separately have key components, where each person knows only their own key component, and the individual key components convey no knowledge of other components or of the original cryptographic key. dual control requires two or more people to authenticate the use of a cryptographic key or perform a key-management function. no single person can access or use the authentication factor (for example, the password, pin, or key) of another.
