Examples: An entity could implement a dmz, which is a part of the network that manages connections between an untrusted network (for examples of untrusted networks refer to the requirement 1 overview) and services that an organization needs to have available to the public, such as a web server. please note that if an entity\u2019s dmz processes or transmits account data (for example, e-commerce website), it is also considered a cde.",
