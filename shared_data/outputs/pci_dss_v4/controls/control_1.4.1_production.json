  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 1.4.1 Defined Approach Requirements: NSCs are implemented between trusted and untrusted networks. Customized Approach Objective: Unauthorized traffic cannot traverse network boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 1.4.1.a: Examine configuration standards and network diagrams to verify that NSCs are defined between trusted and untrusted networks. Testing Procedure 1.4.1.b: Examine network configurations to verify that NSCs are in place between trusted and untrusted networks, in accordance with the documented configuration standards and network diagrams. Guidance: Purpose: Implementing nscs at every connection coming into and out of trusted networks allows the entity to monitor and control access and minimizes the chances of a malicious individual obtaining access to the internal network via an unprotected connection. Examples: An entity could implement a dmz, which is a part of the network that manages connections between an untrusted network (for examples of untrusted networks refer to the requirement 1 overview) and services that an organization needs to have available to the public, such as a web server. please note that if an entity\u2019s dmz processes or transmits account data (for example, e-commerce website), it is also considered a cde.",
