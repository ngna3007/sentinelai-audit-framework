Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 5.2.3.1.a: Examine the entity’s targeted risk analysis for the frequency of periodic evaluations of system components identified as not at risk for malware to verify the risk analysis was performed in accordance with all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1.
Testing Procedure 5.2.3.1.b: Examine documented results of periodic evaluations of system components identified as not at risk for malware and interview personnel to verify that evaluations are performed at the frequency defined in the entity’s targeted risk analysis performed for this requirement.
