Customized Approach Objective: Access rights and privileges are prohibited unless expressly permitted. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 7.3.3: Examine vendor documentation and system settings to verify that the access control system(s) is set to \u201cdeny all\u201d by default. Guidance: Purpose: A default setting of \u201cdeny all\u201d ensures no one is granted access unless a rule is established specifically granting such access. Good Practice: It is important to check the default configuration of access control systems because some are set by default to \u201callow all,\u201d thereby permitting access unless/until a rule is written to specifically deny it.",
