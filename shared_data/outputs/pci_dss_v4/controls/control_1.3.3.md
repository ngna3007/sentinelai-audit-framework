PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 1.3.3

Defined Approach Requirements:
NSCs are installed between all wireless networks and the CDE, regardless of whether the wireless network is a CDE, such that: All wireless traffic from wireless networks into the CDE is denied by default. Only wireless traffic with an authorized business purpose is allowed into the CDE.

Customized Approach Objective:
Unauthorized traffic cannot traverse network boundaries between any wireless networks and wired environments in the CDE.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 1.3.3: Examine configuration settings and network diagrams to verify that NSCs are implemented between all wireless networks and the CDE, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Purpose: The known (or unknown) implementation and exploitation of wireless technology within a network is a common path for malicious individuals to gain access to the network and account data. if a wireless device or network is installed without the entity’s knowledge, a malicious individual could easily and “invisibly” enter the network. if nscs do not restrict access from wireless networks into the cde, malicious individuals that gain unauthorized access to the wireless network can easily connect to the cde and compromise account information.
