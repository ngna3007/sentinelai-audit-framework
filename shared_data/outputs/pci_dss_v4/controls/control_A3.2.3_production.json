PCI DSS Reference: _Requirement 12_ Customized Approach Objective: This requirement is not eligible for the customized approach. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure A3.2.3: Examine policies and procedures to verify that a change to organizational structure results in formal a review of the impact on PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls.

Examples: Changes to organizational structure include, but are not limited to, company mergers or acquisitions, and significant changes or reassignments of personnel with responsibility for security control.",
