  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control A3.2.1 Defined Approach Requirements: PCI DSS scope is documented and confirmed for accuracy at least once every three months and upon significant changes to the in- scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation includes: Identifying all data flows for the various payment stages (for example, authorization, capture, settlement, chargebacks, and refunds) and acceptance channels (for example, card- present, card-not-present, and e-commerce). Updating all data-flow diagrams per Requirement 1.2.4. Identifying all locations where account data is stored, processed, and transmitted, including but not limited to 1) any locations outside of the currently defined CDE, 2) applications that process CHD, 3) transmissions between systems and networks, and 4) file backups. For any account data found outside of the currently defined CDE, either 1) securely delete it, 2) migrate it into the currently defined CDE, or 3) expand the currently defined CDE to include it. Identifying all system components in the CDE, connected to the CDE, or that could impact security of the CDE. __ Customized Approach Objective: This requirement is not eligible for the customized approach. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure A3.2.1.a: Examine documented results of scope reviews and interview personnel to verify that the reviews are performed: At least once every three months. After significant changes to the in-scope environment. Testing Procedure A3.2.1.b: Examine documented results of scope reviews occurring at least once every three months to verify that scoping validation includes all elements specified in this requirement. Guidance: Further Information: Refer to_information supplement: guidance for_ _pci dss scoping and network segmentation_ for additional guidance.",
