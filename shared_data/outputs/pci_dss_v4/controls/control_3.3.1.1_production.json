Customized Approach Objective: This requirement is not eligible for the customized approach. Applicability Notes: In the normal course of business, the following data elements from the track may need to be retained: Cardholder name. Primary account number (PAN). Expiration date. Service code. To minimize risk, store securely only these data elements as needed for business. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 3.3.1.1: Examine data sources to verify that the full contents of any track are not stored upon completion of the authorization process.
