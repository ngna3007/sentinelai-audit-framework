Primary account number (PAN). Expiration date. Service code. To minimize risk, store securely only these data elements as needed for business.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 3.3.1.1: Examine data sources to verify that the full contents of any track are not stored upon completion of the authorization process.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: If full contents of any track (from the magnetic stripe on the back of a card if present, equivalent data contained on a chip, or elsewhere) is stored, malicious individuals who obtain that data can use it to reproduce payment cards and complete fraudulent transactions. Examples: Data sources to review to ensure that the full contents of any track are not retained upon completion of the authorization process include, but are not limited to: incoming transaction data. all logs (for example, transaction, history, debugging, error). history files. trace files. database schemas. contents of databases, and on-premise and cloud data stores. any existing memory/crash dump files. Definitions: Full track data is alternatively called full track, track, track 1, track 2, and magnetic-stripe data. each track contains a number of data elements, and this requirement specifies only those that may be retained post-authorization.",
