Customized Approach Objective: Stored activity records cannot be accessed by unauthorized personnel. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 10.3.1: Interview system administrators and examine system configurations and privileges to verify that only individuals with a job-related need have read access to audit log files. Guidance: Purpose: Audit log files contain sensitive information, and read access to the log files must be limited only to those with a valid business need. this access includes audit log files on the originating systems as well as anywhere else they are stored. Good Practice: Adequate protection of the audit logs includes strong access control that limits access to logs based on \u201cneed to know\u201d only and the use of physical or network segregation to make the logs harder to find and modify.",
