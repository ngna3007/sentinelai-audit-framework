Good Practice: Establishing a baseline of normal audit activity patterns is critical to the effectiveness of an automated log review mechanism. the analysis of new audit activity against the established baseline can significantly improve the identification of suspicious or anomalous activities. the entity should keep logging tools aligned with any changes in their environment by periodically reviewing tool settings and updating settings to reflect any changes. Further Information: Refer to the information supplement:_effective_ _daily log monitoring_ for additional guidance.",
