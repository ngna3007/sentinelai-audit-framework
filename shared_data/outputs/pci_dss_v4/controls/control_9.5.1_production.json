  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 9.5.1 Defined Approach Requirements: POI devices that capture payment card data via direct physical interaction with the payment card form factor are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution, including the following: Maintaining a list of POI devices. Periodically inspecting POI devices to look for tampering or unauthorized substitution. Training personnel to be aware of suspicious behavior and to report tampering or unauthorized substitution of devices. Customized Approach Objective: The entity has defined procedures to protect and manage point-of-interaction devices. Expectations, controls, and oversight for the management and protection of POI devices are defined and adhered to by affected personnel. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 9.5.1: Examine documented policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined that include all elements specified in this requirement. Testing Procedure 9.5.1: POI devices that capture payment card data via direct physical interaction with the payment card form factor are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution, including the following: Maintaining a list of POI devices. Periodically inspecting POI devices to look for tampering or unauthorized substitution. Training personnel to be aware of suspicious behavior and to report tampering or unauthorized substitution of devices. Guidance: Purpose: Criminals attempt to steal payment card data by stealing and/or manipulating card-reading devices and terminals. criminals will try to steal devices so they can learn how to break into them, and they often try to replace legitimate devices with fraudulent devices that send them payment card data every time a card is entered. they will also try to add \u201cskimming\u201d components to the outside of devices, which are designed to capture payment card data before it enters the device\u2014for example, by attaching an additional card reader on top of the legitimate card reader so that the payment card data is captured twice: once by the criminal\u2019s component and then by the device\u2019s legitimate component. in this way, transactions may still be completed without interruption while the criminal is \u201cskimming\u201d the payment card data during the process.",
