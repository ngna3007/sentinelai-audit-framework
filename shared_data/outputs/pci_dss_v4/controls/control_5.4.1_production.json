Meeting this requirement for technical and automated controls to detect and protect personnel against phishing is not the same as Requirement 12.6.3.1 for security awareness training. Meeting this requirement does not also meet the requirement for providing personnel with security awareness training, and vice versa. _This requirement is a best practice until 31 March_ _2025, after which it will be required and must be_ _fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment._\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 5.4.1: Observe implemented processes and examine mechanisms to verify controls are in place to detect and protect personnel against phishing attacks.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: Technical controls can limit the number of occasions personnel have to evaluate the veracity of a communication and can also limit the effects of individual responses to phishing. Good Practice: When developing anti-phishing controls, entities are encouraged to consider a combination of approaches. for example, using anti-spoofing controls such as domain-based message authentication, reporting & conformance (dmarc), sender policy framework (spf), and domain keys identified mail (dkim) will help stop phishers from spoofing the entity\u2019s domain and impersonating personnel. the deployment of technologies for blocking phishing emails and malware before they reach personnel, such as link scrubbers and server-side anti-malware, can reduce incidents and decrease the time required by personnel to check and report phishing attacks. additionally, training personnel to recognize and report phishing emails can allow similar emails to be identified and permit them to be removed before being opened. it is recommended (but not required) that anti- phishing controls are applied across an entity\u2019s entire organization. _(continued on next page)_. Definitions: Phishing is a form of social engineering and describes the different methods used by attackers to trick personnel into disclosing sensitive information, such as user account names and passwords, and account data. attackers will typically disguise themselves and attempt to appear as a genuine or trusted source, directing personnel to send an email response, click on a web link, or enter data into a compromised website. mechanisms that can detect and prevent phishing attempts are often included in anti-malware solutions.
