  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 3.7.8 Defined Approach Requirements: Key management policies and procedures are implemented to include that cryptographic key custodians formally acknowledge (in writing or electronically) that they understand and accept their key-custodian responsibilities. Customized Approach Objective: Key custodians are knowledgeable about their responsibilities in relation to cryptographic operations and can access assistance and guidance when required. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 3.7.8.a: Examine the documented key-management policies and procedures for keys used for protection of stored account data and verify that they define acknowledgments for key custodians in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement. Testing Procedure 3.7.8.b: Examine documentation or other evidence showing that key custodians have provided acknowledgments in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement. Guidance: Purpose: Providing guidance to customers on how to securely transmit, store, and update cryptographic keys can help prevent keys from being mismanaged or disclosed to unauthorized entities. Further Information: Numerous industry standards for key management are cited above in the guidance for requirements 3.7.1- 3.7.8.",
