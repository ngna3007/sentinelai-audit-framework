PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 10.6.1 Defined Approach Requirements: System clocks and time are synchronized using time-synchronization technology. Customized Approach Objective: Common time is established across all systems. Applicability Notes: Keeping time-synchronization technology current includes managing vulnerabilities and patching the technology according to PCI DSS Requirements 6.3.1 and 6.3.3. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 10.6.1: Examine system configuration settings to verify that time-synchronization technology is implemented and kept current. Guidance: Purpose: Time synchronization technology is used to synchronize clocks on multiple systems. when clocks are not properly synchronized, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to compare log files from different systems and establish an exact sequence of events, which is crucial for forensic analysis following a breach. for post-incident forensics teams, the accuracy and consistency of time across all systems and the time of each activity are critical in determining how the systems were compromised. Examples: Network time protocol (ntp) is one example of time-synchronization technology.
