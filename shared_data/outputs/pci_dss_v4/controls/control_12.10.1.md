PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.10.1

Defined Approach Requirements:
(continued)_
An incident response plan exists and is ready to be activated in the event of a suspected or confirmed security incident. The plan includes, but is not limited to: Roles, responsibilities, and communication and contact strategies in the event of a suspected or confirmed security incident, including notification of payment brands and acquirers, at a minimum. Incident response procedures with specific containment and mitigation activities for different types of incidents. Business recovery and continuity procedures. Data backup processes. Analysis of legal requirements for reporting compromises. Coverage and responses of all critical system components. Reference or inclusion of incident response procedures from the payment brands.

Customized Approach Objective:
A comprehensive incident response plan that meets card brand expectations is maintained.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 12.10.1.a: Examine the incident response plan to verify that the plan exists and includes at least the elements specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 12.10.1.b: Interview personnel and examine documentation from previously reported incidents or alerts to verify that the documented incident response plan and procedures were followed.

Guidance:
Purpose: Proper testing of the security incident response plan can identify broken business processes and ensure key steps are not missed, which could result in increased exposure during an incident. periodic testing of the plan ensures that the processes remain viable, as well as ensuring that all relevant personnel in the organization are familiar with the plan. Examples: Legal requirements for reporting compromises include those in most us states, the eu general data protection regulation (gdpr), and the personal data protection act (singapore). Good Practice: The test of the incident response plan can include simulated incidents and the corresponding responses in the form of a “table-top exercise” that includes participation by relevant personnel. a review of the incident and the quality of the response can provide entities with the assurance that all required elements are included in the plan.
