PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.5.2.1

Defined Approach Requirements:
Additional requirement for service_ _providers only:_PCI DSS scope is documented and confirmed by the entity at least once every six months and upon significant change to the in-scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation includes all the elements specified in Requirement 12.5.2.

Customized Approach Objective:
The accuracy of PCI DSS scope is verified to be continuously accurate by comprehensive analysis and appropriate technical measures.

Applicability Notes:
This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. _This requirement is a best practice until 31 March_ _2025, after which it will be required and must be_ _fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment._

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 12.5.2.1.a: **_Additional testing procedure for_** **_service provider assessments only:_** Examine documented results of scope reviews and interview personnel to verify that reviews per Requirement 12.5.2 are performed: At least once every six months, and After significant changes
Testing Procedure 12.5.2.1.b: **_Additional testing procedure for_** **_service provider assessments only:_** Examine documented results of scope reviews to verify that scoping validation includes all elements specified in Requirement 12.5.2.

Guidance:
Purpose: Service providers typically have access to greater volumes of cardholder data than do merchants, or can provide an entry point that can be exploited to then compromise multiple other entities. service providers also typically have larger and more complex networks that are subject to more frequent change. the probability of overlooked changes to scope in complex and dynamic networks is greater in service-providers environments. validating pci dss scope more frequently is likely to discover such overlooked changes before they can be exploited by an attacker.
