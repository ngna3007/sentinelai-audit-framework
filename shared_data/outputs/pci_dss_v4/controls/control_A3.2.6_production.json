Configured to detect and prevent cleartext PAN leaving the CDE via an unauthorized channel, method, or process. Generating audit logs and alerts upon detection of cleartext PAN leaving the CDE via an unauthorized channel, method, or process. PCI DSS Reference: _Scope of PCI DSS_ _Requirements, Requirement 12_\n\nCustomized Approach Objective:\nThis requirement is not eligible for the customized approach.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure A3.2.6.a: Examine documentation and observe implemented mechanisms to verify that the mechanisms are in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.\nTesting Procedure A3.2.6.b: Examine audit logs and alerts, and interview responsible personnel to verify that alerts are investigated.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: The use of mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized pan from leaving the cde allows an organization to detect and prevent situations that may lead to data loss. Examples: Mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized loss of cleartext pan may include the use of appropriate tools such as data loss prevention (dlp) solutions as well as manual processes and procedures. Good Practice: Coverage of the mechanisms should include, but not be limited to, e-mails, downloads to removable media, and output to printers.",
