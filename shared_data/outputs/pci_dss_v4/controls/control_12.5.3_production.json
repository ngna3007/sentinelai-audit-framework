  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.5.3\n\nDefined Approach Requirements:\nAdditional requirement for service_ _providers only:_ Significant changes to organizational structure result in a documented (internal) review of the impact to PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls, with results communicated to executive management.\n\nCustomized Approach Objective:\nPCI DSS scope is confirmed after significant organizational change.\n\nApplicability Notes:\nThis requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider. _This requirement is a best practice until 31 March_ _2025, after which it will be required and must be_ _fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment._\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 12.5.3.a: **_Additional testing procedure for_** **_service provider assessments only:_** Examine policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined such that a significant change to organizational structure results in documented review of the impact to PCI DSS scope and applicability of controls.\nTesting Procedure 12.5.3.b: **_Additional testing procedure for_** **_service provider assessments only:_** Examine documentation (for example, meeting minutes) and interview responsible personnel to verify that significant changes to organizational structure resulted in documented reviews that included all elements specified in this requirement, with results communicated to executive management.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: An organization\u2019s structure and management define the requirements and protocol for effective and secure operations. changes to this structure could have negative effects to existing controls and frameworks by reallocating or removing resources that once supported pci dss controls or inheriting new responsibilities that may not have established controls in place. therefore, it is important to revisit pci dss scope and controls when there are changes to an organization\u2019s structure and management to ensure controls are in place and active. Examples: Changes to organizational structure include, but are not limited to, company mergers or acquisitions, and significant changes or reassignments of personnel with responsibility for security controls.",
