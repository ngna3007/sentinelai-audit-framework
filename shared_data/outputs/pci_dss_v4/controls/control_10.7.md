PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 10.7

Defined Approach Requirements:
Failures of critical security control systems are detected, reported, and responded to promptly.

Guidance:
Purpose: Without formal processes to detect and alert when critical security controls fail, failures may go undetected for extended periods and provide attackers ample time to compromise system components and steal account data from the cde. Good Practice: The specific types of failures may vary, depending on the function of the device system component and technology in use. typical failures include a system ceasing to perform its security function or not functioning in its intended manner, such as a firewall erasing all its rules or going offline.
