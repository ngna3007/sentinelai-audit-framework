PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 11.5

Defined Approach Requirements:
Network intrusions and unexpected file changes are detected and responded to.

Guidance:
Purpose: Intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques (such as ids/ips) compare the traffic coming into the network with known “signatures” and/or behaviors of thousands of compromise types (hacker tools, trojans, and other malware), and then send alerts and/or stop the attempt as it happens. without a proactive approach to detect unauthorized activity, attacks on (or misuse of) computer resources could go unnoticed for long periods of time. the impact of an intrusion into the cde is, in many ways, a factor of the time that an attacker has in the environment before being detected. Good Practice: Security alerts generated by these techniques should be continually monitored, so that the attempted or actual intrusions can be stopped, and potential damage limited. Definitions: Critical locations could include, but are not limited to, network security controls between network segments (for example, between a dmz and an internal network or between an in-scope and out- of-scope network) and points protecting connections between a less trusted and a more trusted system component.
