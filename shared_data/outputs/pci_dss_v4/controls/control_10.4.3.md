PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 10.4.3 Defined Approach Requirements: Exceptions and anomalies identified during the review process are addressed. Customized Approach Objective: Suspicious or anomalous activities are addressed. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 10.4.3.a: Examine security policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined for addressing exceptions and anomalies identified during the review process. Testing Procedure 10.4.3.b: Observe processes and interview personnel to verify that, when exceptions and anomalies are identified, they are addressed. Guidance: Purpose: If exceptions and anomalies identified during the log-review process are not investigated, the entity may be unaware of unauthorized and potentially malicious activities occurring within their network. Good Practice: Entities should consider how to address the following when developing their processes for defining and managing exceptions and anomalies: how log review activities are recorded, how to rank and prioritize exceptions and anomalies, what procedures should be in place to report and escalate exceptions and anomalies, and who is responsible for investigating and for any remediation tasks.
