PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 11.2

Defined Approach Requirements:
Wireless access points are identified and monitored, and unauthorized wireless access points are addressed.

Guidance:
Purpose: Implementation and/or exploitation of wireless technology within a network are common paths for malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the network and cardholder data. unauthorized wireless devices could be hidden within or attached to a computer or other system component. these devices could also be attached directly to a network port, to a network device such as a switch or router, or inserted as a wireless interface card inside a system component. even if a company has a policy prohibiting the use of wireless technologies, an unauthorized wireless device or network could be installed without the company’s knowledge, allowing an attacker to enter the network easily and “invisibly.” detecting and removing such unauthorized access points reduces the duration and likelihood of such devices being leveraged for an attack. _(continued on next page)_.
