Examples: Methods to maintain device locations include identifying the address of the site or facility where the device is located. Good Practice: The method for maintaining a list of devices may be automated (for example, a device- management system) or manual (for example, documented in electronic or paper records). for on-the-road devices, the location may include the name of the personnel to whom the device is assigned.",
