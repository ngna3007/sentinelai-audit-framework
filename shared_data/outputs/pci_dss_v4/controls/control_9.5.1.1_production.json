Device serial number or other methods of unique identification. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 9.5.1.1.a: Examine the list of POI devices to verify it includes all elements specified in this requirement. Testing Procedure 9.5.1.1.b: Observe POI devices and device locations and compare to devices in the list to verify that the list is accurate and up to date. Testing Procedure 9.5.1.1.c: Interview personnel to verify the list of POI devices is updated when devices are added, relocated, decommissioned, etc. Guidance: Purpose: Keeping an up-to-date list of poi devices helps an organization track where devices are supposed to be and quickly identify if a device is missing or lost. . Examples: Methods to maintain device locations include identifying the address of the site or facility where the device is located. Good Practice: The method for maintaining a list of devices may be automated (for example, a device- management system) or manual (for example, documented in electronic or paper records). for on-the-road devices, the location may include the name of the personnel to whom the device is assigned.",
