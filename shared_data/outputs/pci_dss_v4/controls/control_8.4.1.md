PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 8.4.1

Defined Approach Requirements:
MFA is implemented for all non-console access into the CDE for personnel with administrative access.

Customized Approach Objective:
Administrative access to the CDE cannot be obtained by the use of a single authentication factor.

Applicability Notes:
The requirement for MFA for non-console administrative access applies to all personnel with elevated or increased privileges accessing the CDE via a non-console connectionâ€”that is, via logical access occurring over a network interface rather than via a direct, physical connection.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 8.4.1.a: Examine network and/or system configurations to verify MFA is required for all non- console into the CDE for personnel with administrative access.
Testing Procedure 8.4.1.b: Observe administrator personnel logging into the CDE and verify that MFA is required.
