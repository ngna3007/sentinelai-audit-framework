Customized Approach Objective: Customers cannot access other customers\u2019 environments. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure A1.1.2.a: Examine documentation to verify controls are defined such that each customer only has permission to access its own cardholder data and CDE. Testing Procedure A1.1.2.b: Examine system configurations to verify that customers have privileges established to only access their own account data and CDE. Guidance: Purpose: To prevent any inadvertent or intentional impact to other customers\u2019 environments or account data, it is important that each customer can access only resources allocated to that customer. Examples: In a cloud-based infrastructure, such as an infrastructure as a service (iaas) offering, the customers\u2019 cde may include virtual network devices and virtual servers that are configured and managed by the customers, including operating systems, files, memory, etc.",
