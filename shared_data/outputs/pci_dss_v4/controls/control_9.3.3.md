Guidance:
Purpose: A visitor log documenting minimum information about the visitor is easy and inexpensive to maintain. it will assist in identifying historical physical access to a building or room and potential access to cardholder data. Good Practice: When logging the date and time of visit, including both in and out times is considered a best practice, since it provides helpful tracking information and provides assurance that a visitor has left at the end of the day. it is also good to verify that a visitor’s id (driver’s license, etc.) matches the name they put on the visitor log.
