PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 7.3.3 Defined Approach Requirements: The access control system(s) is set to “deny all” by default. Customized Approach Objective: Access rights and privileges are prohibited unless expressly permitted. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 7.3.3: Examine vendor documentation and system settings to verify that the access control system(s) is set to “deny all” by default. Guidance: Purpose: A default setting of “deny all” ensures no one is granted access unless a rule is established specifically granting such access. Good Practice: It is important to check the default configuration of access control systems because some are set by default to “allow all,” thereby permitting access unless/until a rule is written to specifically deny it.
