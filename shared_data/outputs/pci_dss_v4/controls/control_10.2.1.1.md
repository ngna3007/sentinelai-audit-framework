Purpose: Accounts with increased access privileges, such as the “administrator” or “root” account, have the potential to significantly impact the security or operational functionality of a system. without a log of the activities performed, an organization is cannot trace any issues resulting from an administrative mistake or misuse of privilege back to the specific action and account. Definitions: The functions or activities considered to be administrative are beyond those performed by regular users as part of routine business functions. refer to_appendix g_ for the definition of “administrative access.”.
