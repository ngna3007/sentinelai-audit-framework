Good Practice: Anti-malware mechanisms should be updated via a trusted source as soon as possible after an update is available. using a trusted common source to distribute updates to end-user systems helps ensure the integrity and consistency of the solution architecture. updates may be automatically downloaded to a central location\u2014for example, to allow for testing\u2014 prior to being deployed to individual system components.",
