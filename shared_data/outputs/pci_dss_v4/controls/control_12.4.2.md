PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.4.2

Defined Approach Requirements:
Additional requirement for service_ _providers only:_ Reviews are performed at least once every three months to confirm that personnel are performing their tasks in accordance with all security policies and operational procedures. Reviews are performed by personnel other than those responsible for performing the given task and include, but are not limited to, the following tasks: Daily log reviews. Configuration reviews for network security controls. Applying configuration standards to new systems. Responding to security alerts. Change-management processes.

Customized Approach Objective:
The operational effectiveness of critical PCI DSS controls is verified periodically by manual inspection of records.

Applicability Notes:
This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 12.4.2.a: **_Additional testing procedure for_** **_service provider assessments only:_
Testing Procedure 12.4.2.b: **_Additional testing procedure for_** **_service provider assessments only:_

Guidance:
Purpose: Regularly confirming that security policies and procedures are being followed provides assurance that the expected controls are active and working as intended. this requirement is distinct from other requirements that specify a task to be performed. the objective of these reviews is not to reperform other pci dss requirements, but to confirm that security activities are being performed on an ongoing basis. Examples: Looking at requirement 1.2.7 as one example, requirement 12.4.2 is met by confirming, at least once every three months, that reviews of configurations of network security controls have occurred at the required frequency. on the other hand, requirement 1.2.7 is met by reviewing those configurations as specified in the requirement. Good Practice: These reviews can also be used to verify that appropriate evidence is being maintained—for example, audit logs, vulnerability scan reports, reviews of network security control rulesets—to assist in the entity’s preparation for its next pci dss assessment.
