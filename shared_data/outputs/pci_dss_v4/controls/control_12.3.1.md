PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.3.1

Defined Approach Requirements:
(continued)_
For each PCI DSS requirement that specifies completion of a targeted risk analysis, the analysis is documented and includes: Identification of the assets being protected. Identification of the threat(s) that the requirement is protecting against. Identification of factors that contribute to the likelihood and/or impact of a threat being realized. Resulting analysis that determines, and includes justification for, how the frequency or processes defined by the entity to meet the requirement minimize the likelihood and/or impact of the threat being realized. Review of each targeted risk analysis at least once every 12 months to determine whether the results are still valid or if an updated risk analysis is needed. Performance of updated risk analyses when needed, as determined by the annual review.

Customized Approach Objective:
Up to date knowledge and assessment of risks to the CDE are maintained.

Applicability Notes:
_This requirement is a best practice until 31 March_ _2025, after which it will be required and must be_ _fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment._

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 12.3.1: Examine documented policies and procedures to verify a process is defined for performing targeted risk analyses for each PCI DSS requirement that specifies completion of a targeted risk analysis, and that the process includes all elements specified in this requirement.

Guidance:
Good Practice: An enterprise-wide risk assessment, which is a point-in-time activity that enables entities to identify threats and associated vulnerabilities, is recommended, but is not required, for entities to determine and understand broader and emerging threats with the potential to negatively impact its business. this enterprise-wide risk assessment could be established as part of an overarching risk management program that is used as an input to the annual review of an organization's overall information security policy (see requirement 12.1.1). examples of risk-assessment methodologies for enterprise-wide risk assessments include, but are not limited to, iso_ 27005_ and nist_sp 800-30_.
