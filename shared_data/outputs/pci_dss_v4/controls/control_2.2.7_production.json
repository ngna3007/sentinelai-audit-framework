Examples: Cleartext protocols (such as http, telnet, etc.) do not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy for an eavesdropper to intercept this information. non-console access may be facilitated by technologies that provide alternative access to systems, including but not limited to, out-of-band (oob), lights-out management (lom), intelligent platform management interface (ipmi), and keyboard, video, mouse (kvm) switches with remote capabilities. these and other non-console access technologies and methods must be secured with strong cryptography. Good Practice: Whichever security protocol is used, it should be configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection\u2014for example, by using only trusted certificates, supporting only strong encryption, and not supporting fallback to weaker, insecure protocols or methods. Further Information: Refer to industry standards and best practices such as_nist sp 800-52 and sp 800-57_.",
