  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 2.2.7 Defined Approach Requirements: All non-console administrative access is encrypted using strong cryptography. Customized Approach Objective: Cleartext administrative authorization factors cannot be read or intercepted from any network transmissions. Applicability Notes: This includes administrative access via browser- based interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs). Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 2.2.7.a: Examine system configuration standards to verify they include encrypting all non-console administrative access using strong cryptography. Testing Procedure 2.2.7.b: Observe an administrator log on to system components and examine system configurations to verify that non-console administrative access is managed in accordance with this requirement. Testing Procedure 2.2.7.c: Examine settings for system components and authentication services to verify that insecure remote login services are not available for non- console administrative access. Testing Procedure 2.2.7.d: Examine vendor documentation and interview personnel to verify that strong cryptography for the technology in use is implemented according to industry best practices and/or vendor recommendations. Guidance: Purpose: If non-console (including remote) administration does not use encrypted communications, administrative authorization factors (such as ids and passwords) can be revealed to an eavesdropper. a malicious individual could use this information to access the network, become administrator, and steal data. Examples: Cleartext protocols (such as http, telnet, etc.) do not encrypt traffic or logon details, making it easy for an eavesdropper to intercept this information. non-console access may be facilitated by technologies that provide alternative access to systems, including but not limited to, out-of-band (oob), lights-out management (lom), intelligent platform management interface (ipmi), and keyboard, video, mouse (kvm) switches with remote capabilities. these and other non-console access technologies and methods must be secured with strong cryptography. Good Practice: Whichever security protocol is used, it should be configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection\u2014for example, by using only trusted certificates, supporting only strong encryption, and not supporting fallback to weaker, insecure protocols or methods. Further Information: Refer to industry standards and best practices such as_nist sp 800-52 and sp 800-57_.",
