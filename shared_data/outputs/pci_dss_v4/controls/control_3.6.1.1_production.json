Inventory of any hardware security modules (HSMs), key management systems (KMS), and other secure cryptographic devices (SCDs) used for key management, including type and location of devices, to support meeting Requirement 12.3.4. Customized Approach Objective: Accurate details of the cryptographic architecture are maintained and available. Guidance: Purpose: Maintaining current documentation of the cryptographic architecture enables an entity to understand the algorithms, protocols, and cryptographic keys used to protect stored account data, as well as the devices that generate, use, and protect the keys. this allows an entity to keep pace with evolving threats to its architecture and plan for updates as the assurance level provided by different algorithms and key strengths changes. maintaining such documentation also allows an entity to detect lost or missing keys or key- management devices and identify unauthorized additions to its cryptographic architecture. the use of the same cryptographic keys in both production and test environments introduces a risk of exposing the key if the test environment is not at the same security level as the production environment. Good Practice: Having an automated reporting mechanism can assist with maintenance of the cryptographic attributes.",
