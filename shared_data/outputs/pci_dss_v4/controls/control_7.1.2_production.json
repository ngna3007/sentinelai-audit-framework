Personnel are accountable for successful, continuous operation of these requirements.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 7.1.2.a: Examine documentation to verify that descriptions of roles and responsibilities for performing activities in Requirement 7 are documented and assigned.\nTesting Procedure 7.1.2.b: Interview personnel with responsibility for performing activities in Requirement 7 to verify that roles and responsibilities are assigned as and are understood.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: If roles and responsibilities are not formally assigned, personnel may not be aware of their day-to-day responsibilities, and critical activities may not occur. Examples: Access control models that entities can consider include role-based access control (rbac) and attribute-based access control (abac). the access control model used by a given entity depends on their business and access needs. Good Practice: Roles and responsibilities may be documented within policies and procedures or maintained within separate documents. as part of communicating roles and responsibilities, entities can consider having personnel acknowledge their acceptance and understanding of their assigned roles and responsibilities. Definitions: Key elements of an access control model include: resources to be protected (the systems/devices/data to which access is needed), job functions that need access to the resource (for example, system administrator, call-center personnel, store clerk), and which activities each job function needs to perform (for example, read/write or query). once job functions, resources, and activities per job functions are defined, individuals can be granted access accordingly.",
