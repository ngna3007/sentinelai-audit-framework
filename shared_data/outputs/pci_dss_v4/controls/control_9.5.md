PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 9.5

Defined Approach Requirements:
Point-of-interaction (POI) devices are protected from tampering and unauthorized substitution.

Guidance:
Purpose: Criminals attempt to steal payment card data by stealing and/or manipulating card-reading devices and terminals. criminals will try to steal devices so they can learn how to break into them, and they often try to replace legitimate devices with fraudulent devices that send them payment card data every time a card is entered. they will also try to add “skimming” components to the outside of devices, which are designed to capture payment card data before it enters the device—for example, by attaching an additional card reader on top of the legitimate card reader so that the payment card data is captured twice: once by the criminal’s component and then by the device’s legitimate component. in this way, transactions may still be completed without interruption while the criminal is “skimming” the payment card data during the process.
