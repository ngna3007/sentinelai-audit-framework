  "chunk": "PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 1.3.3\n\nDefined Approach Requirements:\nNSCs are installed between all wireless networks and the CDE, regardless of whether the wireless network is a CDE, such that: All wireless traffic from wireless networks into the CDE is denied by default. Only wireless traffic with an authorized business purpose is allowed into the CDE.\n\nCustomized Approach Objective:\nUnauthorized traffic cannot traverse network boundaries between any wireless networks and wired environments in the CDE.\n\nTesting Procedures:\nTesting Procedure 1.3.3: Examine configuration settings and network diagrams to verify that NSCs are implemented between all wireless networks and the CDE, in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.\n\nGuidance:\nPurpose: The known (or unknown) implementation and exploitation of wireless technology within a network is a common path for malicious individuals to gain access to the network and account data. if a wireless device or network is installed without the entity\u2019s knowledge, a malicious individual could easily and \u201cinvisibly\u201d enter the network. if nscs do not restrict access from wireless networks into the cde, malicious individuals that gain unauthorized access to the wireless network can easily connect to the cde and compromise account information.",
