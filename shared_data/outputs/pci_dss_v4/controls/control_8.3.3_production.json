Examples: Methods to verify a user\u2019s identity include a secret question/answer, knowledge-based information, and calling the user back at a known and previously established phone number. Good Practice: Modifications to authentication factors for which user identity should be verified include but are not limited to performing password resets, provisioning new hardware or software tokens, and generating new keys.",
