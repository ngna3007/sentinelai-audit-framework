Customized Approach Objective: Unauthorized individuals cannot gain system access by impersonating the identity of an authorized user. Testing Procedures: Testing Procedure 8.3.3: Examine procedures for modifying authentication factors and observe security personnel to verify that when a user requests a modification of an authentication factor, the user\u2019s identity is verified before the authentication factor is modified. Guidance: Purpose: Malicious individuals use \"social engineering\u201d techniques to impersonate a user of a system \u2014 for example, calling a help desk and acting as a legitimate user\u2014to have an authentication factor changed so they can use a valid user id. requiring positive identification of a user reduces the probability of this type of attack succeeding. Examples: Methods to verify a user\u2019s identity include a secret question/answer, knowledge-based information, and calling the user back at a known and previously established phone number. Good Practice: Modifications to authentication factors for which user identity should be verified include but are not limited to performing password resets, provisioning new hardware or software tokens, and generating new keys.",
