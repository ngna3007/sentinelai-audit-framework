The presence of logs in all<br>environments allows thorough tracking, alerting,<br>and analysis when something goes wrong.<br>Determining the cause of a compromise is very<br>difficult, if not impossible, without a process to<br>corroborate information from critical system<br>components and systems that perform security<br>functions, such as network security controls,<br>IDS/IPS, and file integrity monitoring (FIM)<br>systems. Thus, logs for all critical system<br>components and systems that perform security<br>functions need to be collected, correlated, and<br>maintained. This could include using software<br>products and service methodologies to provide<br>real-time analysis, alerting, and reporting, such as<br>security information and event management<br>(SIEM), FIM, or change detection.|",
