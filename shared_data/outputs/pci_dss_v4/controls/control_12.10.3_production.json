Good Practice: Often, specific personnel are designated to be part of a security incident response team, with the team having overall responsibility for responding to incidents (perhaps on a rotating schedule basis) and managing those incidents in accordance with the plan. the incident response team can consist of core members who are permanently assigned or \u201con-demand\u201d personnel who may be called up as necessary, depending on their expertise and the specifics of the incident. having available resources to respond quickly to incidents minimizes disruption to the organization. examples of types of activity the team or individuals should respond to include any evidence of unauthorized activity, detection of unauthorized wireless access points, critical ids alerts, and reports of unauthorized critical system or content file changes.",
