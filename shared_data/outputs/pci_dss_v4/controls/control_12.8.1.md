PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 12.8.1

Defined Approach Requirements:
A list of all third-party service providers (TPSPs) with which account data is shared or that could affect the security of account data is maintained, including a description for each of the services provided.

Customized Approach Objective:
Records are maintained of TPSPs and the services provided.

Applicability Notes:
The use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make an entity PCI DSS compliant, nor does it remove the entityâ€™s responsibility for its own PCI DSS compliance.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 12.8.1.a: Examine policies and procedures to verify that processes are defined to maintain a list of TPSPs, including a description for each of the services provided, for all TPSPs with whom account data is shared or that could affect the security of account data.
Testing Procedure 12.8.1.b: Examine documentation to verify that a list of all TPSPs is maintained that includes a description of the services provided.
