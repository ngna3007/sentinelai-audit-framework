PCI DSS 4_0_1 Requirement Control 11.2.1

Defined Approach Requirements:
Authorized and unauthorized wireless access points are managed as follows: The presence of wireless (Wi-Fi) access points is tested for, All authorized and unauthorized wireless access points are detected and identified, Testing, detection, and identification occurs at least once every three months. If automated monitoring is used, personnel are notified via generated alerts.

Customized Approach Objective:
Unauthorized wireless access points are identified and addressed periodically.

Testing Procedures:
Testing Procedure 11.2.1.a: Examine policies and procedures to verify processes are defined for managing both authorized and unauthorized wireless access points with all elements specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 11.2.1.b: Examine the methodology(ies) in use and the resulting documentation, and interview personnel to verify processes are defined to detect and identify both authorized and unauthorized wireless access points in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 11.2.1.c: Examine wireless assessment results and interview personnel to verify that wireless assessments were conducted in accordance with all elements specified in this requirement.
Testing Procedure 11.2.1.d: If automated monitoring is used, examine configuration settings to verify the configuration will generate alerts to notify personnel.

Guidance:
Examples: Methods that may be used include but are not limited to wireless network scans, physical/logical inspections of system components and infrastructure, network access control (nac), or wireless ids/ips. nac and wireless ids/ips are examples of automated monitoring tools. Good Practice: The size and complexity of an environment will dictate the appropriate tools and processes to be used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been installed in the environment. for example, performing a detailed physical inspection of a single stand-alone retail kiosk in a shopping mall, where all communication components are contained within tamper-resistant and tamper-evident casings, may be sufficient to provide assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been attached or installed. however, in an environment with multiple nodes (such as in a large retail store, call center, server room or data center), detailed physical inspection can be difficult. in this case, multiple methods may be combined, such as performing physical system inspections in conjunction with the results of a wireless analyzer. Definitions: This is also referred to as rogue access point detection.
