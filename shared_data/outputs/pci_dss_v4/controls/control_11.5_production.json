Good Practice: Security alerts generated by these techniques should be continually monitored, so that the attempted or actual intrusions can be stopped, and potential damage limited. Definitions: Critical locations could include, but are not limited to, network security controls between network segments (for example, between a dmz and an internal network or between an in-scope and out- of-scope network) and points protecting connections between a less trusted and a more trusted system component.",
