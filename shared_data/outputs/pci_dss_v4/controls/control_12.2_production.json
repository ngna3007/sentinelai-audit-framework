Good Practice: It is important that usage policies are supported by technical controls to manage the enforcement of the policies. structuring polices as simple \u201cdo\u201d and \u201cdo not\u201d requirements that are linked to a purpose can help remove ambiguity and provide personnel with the context for the requirement.",
