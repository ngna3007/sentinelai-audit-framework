  ],
  "summary": "While several specific CloudFront and Transfer Family related rules are implicitly compliant due to the absence of relevant resources or non-compliant configurations, the presence of an EC2 instance with SSH (Port 22) openly accessible from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) is a critical non-compliance with PCI DSS Control 1.2.5. This open port indicates a service/protocol that is not adequately identified, approved, or does not have a defined business need for such broad access, posing a significant security risk. Therefore, the overall compliance status for this control is Non-Compliant."
