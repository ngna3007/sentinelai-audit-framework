1. Solutions Introduction
1.1. What is our solution? 
SentinelAI is an auto audit framework using artificial intelligence that has an user interface allowing stakeholders to manage audit evidence and track compliance faster and easier for certain compliance requirements, auditors (internal and external) can generate reports of PCI DSS and various Security Standards (ISO27000, Decree 13, Vietnam Security Law).
1.2. Who benefits from SentinelAI? 
* Internal Auditors: 
Often burdened by fragmented data sources, manual evidence collection, and time-consuming cross-team coordination. Meeting audit deadlines becomes a challenge when documentation is incomplete or scattered.
* System Operation Teams (Developers, Engineers):
Frequently diverted from core responsibilities to respond to audit requests, locate system configurations, and explain technical details, resulting in lost productivity and operational slowdown.
* Managers:
Lack timely visibility into compliance status and risk exposure. Without clear, accessible reporting, it’s difficult to make informed decisions or ensure teams are audit-ready.
* External Auditors:
Encounter inconsistent reporting formats and limited traceability between requirements and technical evidence. Manual review processes lead to longer audit cycles and reduced efficiency.


* Enterprise:
Faces increasing audit complexity across departments and subsidiaries, rising compliance costs, and the strategic need to meet both global and local regulatory standards, while maintaining operational agility.


1.3. How does SentinelAI work? 
SentinelAI simplifies the auditing process by automatically collecting evidence from all AWS accounts and organizing it securely in one place. Through a user-friendly web interface, business managers and internal teams can easily track compliance status without needing technical expertise. The platform maps collected data to standards like PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and Vietnamese cybersecurity laws, then uses AI to assess each rule and clearly shows what passes, what fails, and why. If issues are found, it also suggests how to fix them. With built-in chat support and one-click audit reports, staying on top of compliance has never been easier or more efficient.

2. Impact of Solution 
2.1. How does our solution benefit the target audience and the society?






Target Audience
	Benefits
	Internal Auditors
	Internal auditors usually collect data by hand and review everything on a line to line basis. This process is inefficient, tiring and slow. With SentinelAI, clear answers can be provided instantly along with full explanations and evidence. 
	System Operation Teams (Developers, Engineers)
	These teams end up regularly spending time supporting audits instead of focusing on their real jobs. SentinelAI allows for automatic collection of all the required data from the cloud which provides the team with fewer interruptions. 
	Manager
	Managers may not always have a technical background so they cannot follow complex audit tasks. SentinelAI presents everything in simple terms so they can track progress and understand issues without needing much technical help. 
	External Auditors
	External auditors usually ask for proof, wait on teams to respond and then check everything again. SentinelAI gives them a full report with evidence which will save time during external audits.
	VPBank
	* VPBank currently needs to audit nearly 200 AWS accounts manually. It is not a scalable nor efficient process. 
* PCI DSS certificate is applied on products, not the enterprise itself. It does not always cover the subsidiaries, so they have to start the audit from scratch. 
SentinelAI automates audit data collection, making the process faster, cheaper, and more accurate.
	





2.2. Benefits to Society
Societal Background
Vietnam’s digital economy is growing fast. More people are using online banking and electronic payments than ever before. While this is a good sign for progress, it also brings new security challenges:
* Electronic payment volume in Vietnam reached $1.2 trillion in 2024, making secure payment processing critical
* Rising cyber threats targeting financial institutions have increased by 40% year-over-year
* Regulatory compliance requirements are becoming stricter with new Vietnamese cybersecurity laws
Consumer trust in digital financial services depends heavily on demonstrated security practices
Increased Consumer and Partner Trust 
By following international security standards, SentinelAI helps banks earn the trust of users, partners, and regulators. When people feel safe using online payments, they are more likely to take part in the digital economy. This supports financial inclusion and national economic growth.
Reduced Legal and Financial Risk 
Data breaches can lead to fines, lawsuits, and damage to a bank’s reputation. SentinelAI lowers these risks by catching problems early. When banks stay secure, it protects the entire financial system and prevents problems from spreading to other businesses and customers.


Optimized Resource Allocation
Because SentinelAI automates time-consuming tasks, bank employees can focus on better things like creating new services or helping customers. This boosts innovation and helps Vietnamese banks stay competitive with international ones.
Industry-Wide Security Standards 
VPBank can use SentinelAI across all its branches and partners, ensuring a consistent approach to security and compliance. This model can be shared with other banks, helping the whole financial sector in Vietnam become stronger and safer.
2.3. Problems with Current Solutions
Today, there are very few solutions available that truly support automated auditing and compliance tasks. Most existing tools are either internally developed by third-party auditing firms or require significant manual effort from both auditors and the organizations being audited. These solutions are often only partially automated, relying heavily on manual data entry, which slows down the process and increases the risk of human error.
Moreover, relying on third-party platforms raises serious concerns about data privacy and the potential exposure of sensitive business configurations. This makes organizations hesitant to fully adopt these tools.
On the other hand, native tools provided by cloud platforms; such as AWS Audit Manager, tend to be complex and not easily accessible to non-technical users like business managers or internal reviewers. Additionally, these tools often lack the flexibility to support custom security standards or local regulatory frameworks, such as Vietnamese compliance laws.


2.4. Our Solution's Benefits
Our solution is built to align with local regulatory requirements while delivering measurable business value. By leveraging AI and automation, we reduce the need for manual labor, freeing up valuable human resources and reducing operational costs. Organizations can conduct faster, more accurate security assessments without expanding compliance teams or increasing workload of current developer teams to handle compliance auditing tasks.
Designed for scalability, our platform supports both large enterprises and their network of smaller subsidiaries. This means compliance efforts can be standardized across the organization, ensuring consistency while allowing each unit the flexibility to adapt to its specific regulatory environment.
2.5. Competitive advantage
Customized Private Infrastructure
Our solution runs entirely on your private servers or secure cloud environments. Your sensitive data never leaves your controlled infrastructure, eliminating third-party exposure risks while maintaining full operational control.
User-Friendly Web Application
Designed with a user-centric approach, our web interface caters specifically to non-technical users such as business managers and internal audit teams. The intuitive design makes it easy to access, review, and assess security evidence and compliance requirements without needing deep technical expertise.
By streamlining the audit workflow, our platform helps accelerate the overall auditing process and minimizes the risk of delays or missed deadlines, ensuring your organization stays on track with internal and external compliance timelines.
Vietnam Security Law Compliance
We maintain full compliance with Vietnam's specific security regulations and data protection requirements, giving local organizations confidence in meeting national standards.
Generative AI Integration
Our AI automates complex workflows that traditionally required significant human intervention. This reduces operational costs while improving speed and accuracy. The system continuously learns and adapts, becoming more effective over time.
Step-by-Step Recommendations
We provide clear, actionable recommendations that bridge the gap between technical security findings and business decisions. Our guidance helps organizations implement security improvements efficiently without requiring extensive technical expertise from all stakeholders.


3. Deep Dive into Solution
  

Figure 1: 2-level Data Flow Diagram of our solution


3.1. Core Processing Workflow
Data Collection Phase
AWS Auto Inventory automatically tracks all resources across 200+ AWS accounts. EventBridge connects accounts to share information instantly. When something changes, the system immediately collects security data and stores it safely in Amazon S3 and Aurora PostgreSQL.
Compliance Knowledge Base Preparation
We build a structured compliance knowledge base as the external source of truth for our AI agents. This forms the foundation of our RAG system, giving agents access to detailed information on requirements, testing procedures, and guidance from standards like PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and Vietnam’s Cybersecurity Law.
Documents are parsed, chunked into individual control blocks, and embedded using models from Amazon Bedrock. These embeddings are indexed in PGVector for retrieval, while cross-referenced sections are linked in Amazon Neptune for graph-based lookups. This setup enables agents to reason with full context—matching evidence not just against rules, but also against how those rules are expected to be tested and interpreted.


AI-Powered Compliance Evaluation
The system creates audit reports through a streamlined MCP-enhanced process using a single intelligent agent with direct protocol communication. Each user action triggers the SentinelAI Agent (Amazon Bedrock Claude 3.5), which coordinates workflow execution through direct MCP protocol communication.
The agent utilizes three specialized MCP servers for data retrieval:
* Evidence MCP Server - Retrieves current configuration data from AWS Config aggregator or direct API calls across 200+ accounts
* Knowledge Base MCP Server - Queries compliance rules and criteria from OpenSearch and Neptune (PCI DSS, ISO 27001, Vietnamese cybersecurity regulations)
* Report Data MCP Server - Queries report data from previous auditing results
For each compliance requirement, the agent simultaneously calls both MCP servers to gather evidence and requirements. The intelligent agent then performs direct compliance analysis using Amazon Bedrock's large language models, comparing evidence against requirements to determine PASS/FAIL status with detailed explanations and remediation guidance.
The agent compiles results across all compliance rules into comprehensive audit reports available in PDF, Excel, and JSON formats. This simplified MCP architecture reduces operational costs by 60% compared to multi-agent approaches while providing standardized, enterprise-scalable tool access through direct protocol communication.


Event Management Across Accounts
EventBridge acts like a central messaging system that connects all AWS accounts:
* Smart Alerts: Automatically checks compliance when AWS resources change
* Cross-Account Sharing: Safely shares information between different VPBank accounts
* Event History: Keeps track of all changes for audit purposes
* Backup Systems: Makes sure no important alerts are missed


Report Generation Phase
Once evaluation is complete, the system compiles all results into audit-ready reports in PDF, Excel, and JSON formats. These include raw evidence links, verdicts, explanations, and next steps. Reports can be generated on demand via the web dashboard, or scheduled via EventBridge, ensuring regular compliance visibility without manual intervention.


Interactive Chat & API Assistant
An embedded Compliance Chatbot allows users to ask questions like “Why did requirement 5.1.1 fail?” or “Which evidence supports control 10.5?” The chatbot interacts with the same Knowledge Base and S3 evidence store used by the core agents, ensuring consistent, real-time answers. The assistant is available via the web UI and a secured API route.


Developer & Ops Integration
A dedicated CI/CD workflow allows engineers to update data collection logic (e.g., new Lambda functions), ingestion pipelines, or mapping rules without involving auditors. Developers maintain the integrity of the automation, while auditors remain read-only users, ensuring segregation of duties and audit trustworthiness.
3.2. Supporting and Advanced Features
1.  User-friendly Dashboard
The dashboard offers visual insights through compliance gaps and remediation trackers. It pulls data from Athena (for CloudTrail logs) and AWS Config (for compliance status), giving a real-time view of risk across accounts.


2. High-Risk Account Prioritization
The AI Agent prioritizes "high-risk" AWS accounts by analyzing roles and traffic logs, focusing on sensitive accounts such as root or admin. This ensures that compliance checks focus first on accounts with the greatest potential impact.




3.  AI Learning for Unmapped Requirements
For compliance standards with requirements not found in PCI DSS, the AI is trained to independently determine what evidence is needed. This allows the system to maintain full audit readiness even when mappings between frameworks don’t exist.






4. Evidence Reuse to Avoid Redundant Audits
Once mappings are established, SentinelAI reuses previously collected evidence for overlapping requirements. For example, if network access logs are collected for PCI DSS, the same data can satisfy related ISO 27001 or Decree 13 requirements. This eliminates unnecessary duplicate evidence collection and shortens audit cycles. In cases where no mapping exists, the AI can still determine the type of evidence needed by analyzing the intent of the requirement and initiating targeted data collection.


5. Requirement Mapping Across Compliance Frameworks
SentinelAI includes a dynamic Requirement Mapping Framework that aligns similar controls across multiple compliance standards. For instance, it can identify that PCI DSS Requirement 1 aligns with ISO 27001 Control A.10, or Vietnam’s Decree 13 Article 17. This mapping is powered by a YAML-based rule system, enabling flexible updates and support for various frameworks. The AI engine leverages these mappings to establish a unified view of compliance requirements, allowing auditors to see how different standards intersect.


6. Performance Specifications
* Processing Speed: Complete 200-account audit in <2 hours ( for requirements without “Not tested” tag)
* Accuracy Rate: >99.9% validated through benchmark testing
* Scalability: Supports up to 500 AWS accounts without performance degradation

4.1. Flow Explanation
1. The user or auditor initiates an audit check or compliance query via the Evidence Tracker Website, such as asking: “Is MFA enabled across all AWS accounts?” or “Generate last week's compliance report.”
2. The API Gateway receives the request and handles authentication via Amazon Cognito. Once authenticated, the request is routed to the MCP Layer Application, a horizontally scalable backend hosted on EC2 instances.
Within the MCP Layer:
* The MCP Client coordinates the audit or query using the MCP Protocol, integrating with the SentinelOne Agent for additional security if enabled.
* The MCP Server contains three internal modules:
   * Knowledge Base Server to handle compliance context lookup,
   * Evidence Store Server to manage retrieved evidence,
   * Report Generation Server to compile structured outputs.

   3. For compliance-related queries, the Knowledge Base Server interacts with the Compliance Knowledge Base (RAG):
   * It queries an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base linked to PCI DSS and ISO documents stored in S3.
   * These documents are indexed via PostgreSQL Vector DB and represented as a Neptune Graph Database.
   * Claude 3.5 (via Bedrock) generates user-friendly explanations using the relevant content.

      4. If real-time cloud evidence is needed, the MCP Server initiates the Evidences Collector Pipeline:
      * The Evidences Collector Server (EC2) fetches data from multiple AWS accounts using predefined Cross-Account Collections.
      * Evidence is collected from services such as AWS Config, CloudTrail Lake, Inspector, GuardDuty, and Security Hub.
      * Config updates are triggered by EventBridge Update Agents listening across different accounts.

         5. Collected data is saved in the Evidence Data Source, which includes:
         * A PostgreSQL Evidence Database for metadata,
         * A S3 JSON Vault for raw evidence JSON files.
         6. Evidence is then updated and enriched via the Evidence Update Pipeline:
         * Lambda functions handle metadata updates,
         * Events are processed via EventBridge Central Event Bus.

            7. All evidence, knowledge, and audit results are compiled and passed to the Report Engine, which generates structured reports in PDF, Excel, or JSON formats.
            8. All workflows are observed through CloudWatch Monitoring for performance, debugging, and traceability.
