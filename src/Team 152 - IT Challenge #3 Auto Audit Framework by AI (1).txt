1. NON-TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
1.1. Social and Business Context
________________


1.1.1. Social Context
The 21st century is the era of technology and artificial intelligence. Accompanying the rapid growth of technology is the increase in cybersecurity threats, both in number and in sophistication. Data is considered the heart of a business: the more data a business has, the higher its chances of success. There are various types of data in the world, and not all are evaluated as equally important. However, data related to human identity, financial statements, and money flow is especially critical, as these are the main components that determine the success of a business.
In Vietnam, banking and insurance are considered two industries that collect and store most of the sensitive data mentioned above. Therefore, a bank like VPBank becomes an attractive target for attackers aiming to invade the center of the economy, due to the sensitive data it manages, from cardholder information to transaction records.
From another perspective, the Vietnamese government is placing more emphasis on personal data protection to ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) of all Vietnamese citizens is protected when using services related to payments, banking, and more. PCI DSS certification and local regulations from the State Bank of Vietnam are non-negotiable. Failure to comply results not only in fines, but also in reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and legal consequences. 
1.1.2. Business Context
As a business trend in the digital-first era, VPBank is undergoing rapid digital transformation to gain competitive advantages in Vietnam’s dynamic fintech and banking industry. The bank has adopted a cloud-first approach, with a growing number of services now hosted on AWS. Currently, over 200 internal VPBank user accounts interact with this cloud environment. AWS is also a PCI DSS in-scope platform that must be integrated with an automated framework to enhance the efficiency of audit evidence collection.
In general, VPBank is still a newcomer in applying high-level technologies and platforms to its business operations. As a result, there are ongoing challenges related to human resources, knowledge base, cybersecurity awareness, and auditing concepts. Integrating an AI-driven solution can potentially reduce the volume of manual work, allowing human resources to focus on areas that truly require critical thinking, analytical skills, and creativity.


1.2. Problem Statement
________________


Although security certifications like PCI DSS are critical for business operations, the process of onboarding, preparation, and audit evidence collection remains manual, fragmented, and inefficient for most businesses, including VPBank.
Problem 1: Manual, repetitive, ineffective, and time-consuming evidence collection
Today, most organizations still rely on manual methods to prepare audit evidence. Teams must access various tools and platforms to collect logs, screenshots, and configuration details by hand. This evidence is then stored in unstructured formats such as Google Drive, OneDrive, ZIP files, or shared folders.
While some forward-thinking organizations may use shared trackers or pages, these solutions often lack essential features, such as real-time evidence updates and automated synchronization from in-scope platforms or cloud services.
Problem 2: Lack of audit knowledge among technical teams
In most businesses, the personnel involved in interviews with assessment vendors or in the evidence preparation process are often DevOps engineers, developers, or system administrators. These individuals are skilled in delivering and maintaining infrastructure but typically lack knowledge of compliance and audit frameworks. They also often do not have the time or motivation to learn about audit processes.
This results in a significant communication gap:
When third-party assessment vendors request evidence or conduct interviews, technical teams may provide the wrong type of evidence or misinterpret the requirements. While some companies have a dedicated security audit team to help bridge this gap, the process remains inefficient. Audit teams often act merely as intermediaries between assessors and technical teams, which adds more layers without improving clarity.
The situation is even more challenging for small and mid-sized businesses that lack the budget to hire a dedicated security audit team. In these cases, the gap widens, leading to more delays, confusion, and increased audit risk. True efficiency can only be achieved when both sides communicate directly and understand each other’s needs clearly.
Problem 3: Incomplete or outdated evidence increases audit risk
Another major challenge is that audit evidence can quickly become outdated. In dynamic environments like AWS, resources, configurations, and permissions change frequently. Without an automated synchronization mechanism, the evidence collected and uploaded may no longer accurately reflect the current state of the system at the time of the audit.
This discrepancy introduces significant audit risk:
Assessment vendors may raise additional questions, require further investigation, or even request rework and the implementation of compensating controls, which means increased workload, and more potential non-compliance findings.


1.3. Solution Description
________________


This challenge will focus solely on developing a solution to support the PCI DSS v4.0 certification onboarding process for VPBank. While other certifications such as ISO/IEC 27001 or Vietnam’s Decree No. 13 on personal data protection are relevant and may be considered in the future, they are not mandatory requirements for this challenge. Instead, they will be evaluated as potential extensions of the core solution once the PCI DSS framework has been successfully implemented.
For this challenge, our team will build an Auto PCI DSS Audit Tool, with the following main components:
* A portal for evidence tracker
* Audit button to sync latest evidence
* Display compliance reports with detailed status of each requirement (Passed/Failed)
* Recommendations to improve Failed evidence
* A report generator (export to CSV/Excel/PDF files)
* A chatbot to quickly ask about requirement status.
